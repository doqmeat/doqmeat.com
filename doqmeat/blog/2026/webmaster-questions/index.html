    <h1>answering 100 questions about being a webmaster</h1>
    <p>been meaning to do this for a while so let's get to it! questions are from <a href="https://mouseling.net/100webmaster" target="_blank" class="outlink">mouseling.net</a>.</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>1. Please introduce yourself.</dt>
      <dd>hai i'm des. a 25 year old from Puerto Rico who's a computer science student and enjoys having fun.</dd>

      <dt>2. How long have you been making websites?</dt>
      <dd>i've been at it since april 2023.</dd>

      <dt>3. And what got you into the hobby?</dt>
      <dd>i am pretty sure that i was just bored out of my ass one night and decided to create a neocities account. the rest is history.</dd>

      <dt>4. What kind of website are you most interested in?</dt>
      <dd>personal websites! blog websites. anything that can tell me what the person behind the screen is like.</dd>

      <dt>5. What's your workflow? Do you plan your websites out thoroughly or do you come up with the design as you go along?</dt>
      <dd>i basically need to have a general idea of how the design will be from the start. i usually do sketches of how i want a layout to look like with a said color palette and some pictures for inspirations. once i start coding, the process usually takes me to places where the initial sketch of the layout looks VERY different from the final product.
        <br>
        you can see an example of this in this sketch made for my current homepage.
        <figure>
          <img src="homepage.png" alt="sketch of my current homepage. made in jan of 2025.">
          <figcaption>you can clearly see that the idea is still the same but it's still very different from the final product!</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </dd>

      <dt>6. Please link to your biggest inspirations.</dt>
      <dd>basically everything i have ever seen and interacted with inspires me. i get my inspiration from random stuff i see in real life (like some piece of clothing that with a nice color palette) to random websites i stumble upon on the web. i have MANY inspirations but here's some websites that have inspired me as of late:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://chia.design/" target="_blank">chia.design</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://youhavetosaveyourlife.com" target="_blank">youhavetosaveyourlife</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://petrapixel.neocities.org/" target="_blank">petrapixel.neocities.org</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://ribo.zone/" target="_blank">ribo.zone</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://cinni.net/" target="_blank">cinni.net</a></li>
        </ul>
      </dd>

      <dt>7. What's your favourite part about making websites?</dt>
      <dd>i really fuck with CSS ngl and i think it's fun. besides that, just the thought of creating something from the ground up that is 100% me is also very nice.</dd>

      <dt>8. And the thing you struggle with the most?</dt>
      <dd>i think making a website with a backend is something that i have struggled bc i don't even know where to begin! but i've never done that to actively struggle with it... so... i guess i can say here that i do struggle with making more complex interactive things with JS though i also find that very fun to do / figure out.</dd>

      <dt>9. Do you keep the same layout on all of your pages? Or do you use different ones?</dt>
      <dd>if you are this deep into doqmeat.com reading this then you know the answer to this one! i think i just like learning new things and experimenting with the stuff i learn. i have some websites that share a layout across all pages. for doqmeat, i basically treat this place as my playground. i just find it too boring to keep the same layout across all pages.</dd>

      <dt>10. How confident are you with CSS?</dt>
      <dd>pretty confident! i know my way around CSS media queries to make a page responsive as well as a flexbox and grid layout. also pseudo-classes are fucking awesome.</dd>

      <dt>11. Do you know how to correctly use &lt;dl&gt;?</dt>
      <dd>i guess? if i remember correctly this is a definition list but i have never used these HTML tags before.</dd>

      <dt>12. What is your favourite HTML element?</dt>
      <dd><code>&lt;details&gt;</code> is pretty goated.</dd>

      <dt>13. If you're making a new web page from scratch, what is the first thing you do?</dt>
      <dd>create a CSS file and add a * rule where the box-sizing gets set to border box instead of content box.</dd>

      <dt>14. Do you know JavaScript?</dt>
      <dd>through osmosis via C++. the syntax is very similar so that helps me out a lot. though i have been learning quite a bit via my small projects such as the <a href="https://doqmeat.github.io/js-walkman-mp3-player/" target="_blank" class="outlink">walkman mp3 player</a> and a silly page i did for my girlfriend where you have to make two <a href="/fish-love" target="_blank">fish kiss</a>.</dd>

      <dt>15. How about PHP?</dt>
      <dd>I REALLY WANNA LEARN PHP so a site of mine can have a proper backend with a database. so no, i don't know it yet but i am currently taking a class called <i>databases</i> so hopefully i will be learning PHP pretty soon.</dd>

      <dt>16. Does your website have a theme that you stick to?</dt>
      <dd>not really tbh.</dd>

      <dt>17. Are you more focused on content or design?</dt>
      <dd>i feel like both. maybe... it depends on what page im at.</dd>

      <dt>18. Do you own a domain name? If not, would you ever want to?</dt>
      <dd>yes. i own 3 domains. doqmeat.com, sepiarecord.net, and desteny.me</dd>

      <dt>19. What do you think of nostalgia-focused or "retro" websites?</dt>
      <dd>awesomesauce to me!</dd>

      <dt>20. Is your HTML valid? Do you even check?</dt>
      <dd>i do check! well let's see.</dd>

      <dt>21. What are your opinion on buttons and banners?</dt>
      <dd>also awesomesauce! i love <a title="my button wall" href="/sites">buttons</a> and other <a href="/collection/internet-graphics">internet graphics</a> as i like to call it</dd>

      <dt>22. What do you think of button walls in particular?</dt>
      <dd>exactly. i love them.</dd>

      <dt>23. If you started over again, would you make something similar or completely different?</dt>
      <dd>i think different! recently i learned how to use Static Site Generatos like <a href="https://11ty.dev" target="_blank" class="outlink">11ty</a> and because of how my site is structured (files and such), it would be a pain in the ass to try to build doqmeat.com through a SSG despite the inmmense time that it would save me for pages that have repeating layouts like my <a href="/journal">journal</a> and <a href="/music">music</a> page. if i did this site from scratch, i would probably have to change my workflow and stuff and that's a lot. i don't really see myself starting doqmeat.com from 0, but that is how i would go about it if i did.</dd>

      <dt>24. Are you envious of other people's websites?</dt>
      <dd>yes but it's the pixel sites like <a href="https://lastsecret.net/bitmapdreams/" target="_blank">bitmapdreams</a> or <a href="https://www.lejlart.com/apple.html" target="_blank">appledust</a></dd>

      <dt>25. What text editor do you use?</dt>
      <dd>visual studio code.</dd>

      <dt>26. Why do you use that one?</dt>
      <dd>i downloaded it for my very first computer science class (at the time i was using <a href="https://brackets.io" target="_blank" class="outlink">brackets</a>) and i eventually made it my home to edit my website in</dd>

      <dt>27. Do you host your image files on your web server, or on another host?</dt>
      <dd>HOST YOUR IMAGES IN YOUR OWN SERVER PLEASEEEEEEE. if i have a pet peeve is when people host the images on their sites on random file sharing sites like file garden or catbox or DISCORD???? to answer the question: i host them on the same server.</dd>

      <dt>28. This might not be relevant to you, but what's your opinion on the Neocities vs. Nekoweb debate?</dt>
      <dd>it's not that i don't care but idk why there's even a debate in the first place. they are both communities of the same thing. though i will say that it is nice all the features that nekoweb has been getting in comparison to neocities. but again, i don't see the point in debating which one is better.</dd>

      <dt>29. How much server space would you estimate your main website takes up?</dt>
      <dd>i think last time i checked it was 300mbs? so yeah around that.</dd>

      <dt>30. Do you keep local backups of your files?</dt>
      <dd>i work on my site locally and then push to git and that's how i update my site.</dd>

      <dt>31. Do you prefer simple or highly visual websites?</dt>
      <dd>both!!!!! i love both. while my site is heavy on the visual side, i think there is a lot of beauty in a simplistic site and i am often inspired by them.</dd>

      <dt>32. Do you stick to certain colours? Do you do that on purpose, or is it your subconscious?</dt>
      <dd>i think yes... i think? i rarely use dark colors.</dd>

      <dt>33. Have you ever thought about quitting? Why?</dt>
      <dd>not really. i'm not really focused on getting stuff out frequently so i think that helps with not feeling burnt out. i touch this site whenever i want to work on it and that's it! sometimes i have stuff to say on my journal. sometimes i have an idea for something silly i wanna do. but i don't really care if i'm not updating my site as much.</dd>

      <dt>34. Do you have many webmaster friends, or is it a solitary hobby?</dt>
      <dd>yes!!! i am working on my social skills but i do have people around my web circle that i consider my friends! and no, i don't think this is a solitary hobby. i mean it can be for sure! but it is very much a community-centric hobby and i really like that part of the indie web.</dd>

      <dt>35. Do people in your real life know about your website?</dt>
      <dd>yes! many...</dd>

      <dt>36. Do you update your website very often? How often is "very often"?</dt>
      <dd>kind of answered on <u>question 33</u>! i think every month i give it an update though.</dd>

      <dt>37. And the overall design, do you change that much? Why or why not?</dt>
      <dd>depends on the page! if i feel like something is outdated / need better code / i have a better design in mind for it then i will change it. if not then i won't change it.</dd>

      <dt>38. Is your website more you-focused, hobby-focused, or outside world-focused?</dt>
      <dd>me-focused 100% nowadays. it's also very hobby-focused but i don't have a lot of time to update those pages! outside-world focused? i'm not really sure what this means but i think maybe a little bit.</dd>

      <dt>39. Do you do web design professionally?</dt>
      <dd>this is the goal lowkey. i think it would be neat since i have done <a href="https://vgen.co/doqmeat" target="_blank" class="outlink">commissions</a> before.
      </dd>

      <dt>40. If not, would you like to? And if you're comfortable answering, what do you do for work?</dt>
      <dd>i'm in retail hell right now but also lowkey unemployed. i don't get a lot of shifts.</dd>

      <dt>41. Do you communicate with people by email very much?</dt>
      <dd>YES!!!! i love e-mail very much! send me an email @ meow@doqmeat.com</dd>

      <dt>42. Some people reject social media and use websites as a replacement. Do you keep social media outside of your website?</dt>
      <dd>yessss. i understand the rejection but just like everything, you have to Know how to use it. i am only active on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/doqmeat.com" target="_blank">bluesky</a> and <a href="https://x.com/sepiarecord999" target="_blank">twitter</a></dd>

      <dt>43. How about instant messengers? Do you use a mainstream one like Discord or Telegram? Or something like Matrix? Do you avoid them?</dt>
      <dd>i am an e-mail truther. i would only share my discord with close online friends since i'm not that great with conversations.</dd>

      <dt>44. Do you listen to music while you work on websites? If so, what kinds of artists?</dt>
      <dd>yes. i mostly play new albums i haven't heard so any artist goes.</dd>

      <dt>45. Do you keep everything you make on one website, or do you have more than one?</dt>
      <dd>i have more than one! you can see them all at <a href="https://sepiarecord.net" target="_blank" class="outlink">sepiarecord.net</a>, which is a collective of my sites and projects.</dd>

      <dt>46. On a similar note, do you keep to one topic on your site, or many?</dt>
      <dd>many.</dd>

      <dt>47. Do you present your real self, or at least try? Or do you construct a persona on purpose?</dt>
      <dd>i try to present my real self. how i type and write on my blogs is basically how i talk to friends irl. i don't really try to keep it professional here. but at the end of the day, my website is the presentation of myself that <b>i</b> put on the internet, so some stuff of myself will get filtered out in that process. but i don't put up a persona. i am a bit of a freak irl too.</dd>

      <dt>48. Have you ever made a good friend thanks to your website?</dt>
      <dd>actually yes!!! someone at my uni saw my website and approached me saying they really liked it. and because of that person i got to meet many many many other people.</dd>

      <dt>49. Are you happy with the way HTML and CSS currently work?</dt>
      <dd>i think so yeah. i don't have anything to say about HTML. CSS could do a bit more things to make me happy, but there is always JS to save the day.</dd>

      <dt>50. What are practices that you think people should avoid?</dt>
      <dd> 100 <code>div</code>s followed by another 100 <code>div</code>s</dd>

      <dt>51. What about under-utilised practices, or things you think people should do more?</dt>
      <dd>CSS media queries! not only for phones, but also for people that don't have very wide screens. it's also just nice to have your page be responsive.</dd>

      <dt>52. Do you use a lot of semantic HTML? Or are you guilty of generic structure?</dt>
      <dd>last year i started using a lot of semantic HTML!</dd>

      <dt>53. Do you consider different browsers?</dt>
      <dd>yess i check my sites on chromes and i make them on firefox.</dd>

      <dt>54. Speaking of, what's your preferred browser? Convince your readers why they should use it.</dt>
      <dd>firefox. i can't really convince anyone to use firefox since their CEO said some bs about AI and they are implementing some AI stuff into the browser. i am simply too lazy to switch and i don't even know to WHAT browser. everything sucks. </dd>

      <dt>55. And what OS are you on?</dt>
      <dd>windows 11</dd>

      <dt>56. Do you have a strong opinion on that, or do you just happen to use it?</dt>
      <dd>windows sucks and linux scary. at least to install it on my laptop that i do EVERYTHING on. though i know my way around a terminal so. maybe i'll get there one day idk.</dd>

      <dt>57. Are your websites mobile-friendly?</dt>
      <dd>i try to make them so!</dd>

      <dt>58. What are your thoughts on autoplay?</dt>

      <dt>61. Are your websites "cliche", in your opinion?</dt>

      <dt>63. Are you an artist? Do you draw or design your own assets?</dt>

      <dt>65. Is there a habit you just can't get away from no matter how hard you try?</dt>
      <dd>i think the fact that i hand-code my CSS instead of using libraries and such. i just like it too much. my bad. also i don't really know how to use libraries like that.</dd>

      <dt>66. What's your biggest advice for a new webmaster?</dt>

      <dt>75. Do you have a habit of looking at the source code of websites you visit?</dt>
      <dd>yes! i am always very curious of how other people code their sites and what they use. btw to all webmasters: don't disable right clicking pretty please i LOVE looking at your source code.</dd>

      <dt>76. How did YOU learn how to make websites?</dt>
      <dd>through templates! i didn't know anything about HTML or CSS so i grabbed templates and edited them until i was able to make my own from scratch! the first page i did from scratch was my <a href="/safe-spot">safe-spot</a> #fun-fact. which i have to update so let me put that on my to-do list.</dd>

      <dt>77. Do you ever force elements to do things they're not supposed to?</dt>

      <dt>90. Speaking of programs that help you make websites, what do you think of static site generators (SSGs)? Have you ever used one?</dt>
      <dd>yes! shoutout to <a href="https://11ty.dev" target="_blank" class="outlink">11ty</a>. my <a href="https://siinamota.doqmeat.com" class="outlink">siinamota fansite</a> is made with 11ty.</dd>

      <dd>not really. i would love to participate more of <a href="https://discourse.32bit.cafe" target="_blank" class="outlink">32bit.cafe</a> though</dd>

      <dt>93. Do you write your page content directly into the editor, or do you prepare it elsewhere, like a text document or a Word document?</dt>
      <dd>directly into the editor.</dd>

      <dt>94. Do you think you appear cool to others? A more accurate answer now: do other people ever say you're cool?</dt>
      <dd>i do not wanna know what other people think of me. i prefer inner peace. but i have been told y a couple of people that they really life my site and that im a <q>goat</q>. #testimonials</dd>

      <dt>95. Are you embarrassed of your old work? Have you ever deleted everything out of shame?</dt>
      <dd>eh not really. at least content wise i always have in mind that the things i'm putting here are VERY public despite me being a nobody. so this way i prevent myself from posting stuff i would regret down the line.</dd>

      <dt>96. Would you close down your website if you couldn't update it, or would you leave an archive?</dt>
      <dd>leave an archive! i don't get why people close their websites whem they can't update them anymore.</dd>

      <dt>97. Do you reveal a lot about yourself on your website? Or are you more secretive?</dt>
      <dd>honestly i think i do reveal quite a lot. no locations of course. but i do live in a small island so it's really whatever to me. say hi to me if you see me around.</dd>

      <dt>98. Are you willing to reveal who your best online friend is, and/or if they have a website?</dt>
      <dd>my best online friends are a little friend group (called the effñicks) i made around 2019 and we all keep in touch via discord! there's another friend that i am very close to which i've kept in touch since 2013! none of them have sites though :p</dd>

      <dt>99. And do you optimise the images on your website?</dt>
      <dd>YES. i love compressing my imgs and dithering them. </dd>

      <dt>100. We're out of time! How do you feel after answering 100 questions? ....other than exhausted.</dt>
      <dd>i can't believe i did this in one sitting tbh... i feel okay! gonna get going now though. bye!</dd>
