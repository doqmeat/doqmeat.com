      <p>ever since the <b>look back</b> movie got announced, i have been YEARNING to watch it. after a very painful month of waiting for it to be released in Puerto Rico, it finally premiered yesterday on the island.</p>
      <p>the entire time i was watching this movie, i was just in AWE.... it felt like a dream. there was so much charm and love put into this. i wanted to cry just out of happiness during the first 10 minutes of this movie. i loved how the character had rougher lines while the background just looked so clean and beautiful. it's such a nice little detail that represents fujino and kyomoto's art style so well. having read the one shot some time around 2022, i knew exactly where this movie was gonna go the entire time. and yet i couldn't help but sob for like a good half of the movie. watching this just felt so magical. i absolutely love every single second of this movie. the music was also so so so good and it really added to key moments of the film. i was so emotional when the movie ended... what a beautiful piece of media.</p>
      <img title="movie ticket" src="!g/241025-lookbackticket.png" alt="look back theater ticket" width="30%" style="float:right;margin:10px;">
      <p>i went to the theater in a suit to commemorate the very special occasion of having look back premiere in PR. i was hoping to take a picture next to the poster, because you know, theaters USUALLY have posters displaying the films they are screening. sadly my theater did not have a poster up for look back... possibly to the fact that it got a bit of a limited??? release in PR. since out of the 30 theaters in PR it only premiered in 2. nonetheless, i ended up taking a pic with the ticket machine that displayed a mini version of the poster while choosing the tickets.</p>

        <figcaption>you know i had to do it to them.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>i think it's safe to say that this might be the best movie i have ever watched in my life.</p>
      <p>P.S. if you haven't watched <b>look back</b> if will be available on amazon prime on november 07! and i highly recommend you read it as well. this was the first work of tatsuki fujimoto that i read and it was what got me into his other works like <i>chainsaw man</i> and <i>goodbye eri</i>!</p>
