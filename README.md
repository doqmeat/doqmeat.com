# doqmeat website
hello! this is the repository of [doqmeat.neocities.org](https://doqmeat.neocities.org/) !! 
i code in brackets.io and upload my code using github desktop following miss moss's [deploy to neocities template](https://github.com/burned-salmon/deploy-to-neocities-template)

## source code
- i learned how to code HTML and CSS by looking at other people's code and <b>playing around with it offline</b>, so you're welcome to do that with mine!
- you're free to take <b>bits of my code</b> for your own site!
- with that said, i prefer if you <b>did not copy the entire code and upload it to your site.</b> the only code you can do that with are with my [F2U HTML templates](https://github.com/doqmeat/F2U-templates)

## notes

i'm still pretty new to all of this so any pointers on something i could be doing better are appreciated. this website is just for fun at the end of the day and i am learning at my own pace!
