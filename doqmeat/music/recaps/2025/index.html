    <p>i mostly spent this year on my phone's local music player when it came to listening to music. to my surprise, the samsung music player is pretty decent! early 2025, the spotify hack that i was using suddenly just stopped working <small>though i still use spotify on my pc on my browser with an ad blocker LOL</small>, <a href="https://github.com/anandnet/Harmony-Music" target="_blank">Harmony Music</a> did the job pretty well for streaming songs on my phone but late 2025 they announced that the people behind it will no longer give it support. AND SO this year was when i fully commited to the bit of downloading albums and EPs. my library grew quite a bit. as a consequence i am now more of a album listener than a playlist one. crazy.</p>
    <p>my car has no aux, no bluetooth so i just tune into whatever the radio is playing when i'm on the go. i also have a radio playing constantly in my living room just to catch local news and stuff. i feel like i listened to the radio WAY more this year than 2024. and that is probably because in 2025 i discovered my uni's radio station <a href="https://wrtu.uprrp.edu" target="_blank" class="outlink">radio universidad</a>. i have been fighting for my LIFE trying to find radio stations that are listenable to me. during 2025 i found out about this radio station and i was just amazed at the variety of programs they have. it reminds me a lot of when an online friend of mine hosted a vocaloid program on their university's radio station. maybe one day radio universidad will have that... but sadly i don't think it's opened for students. either way, this radio station has been a highlight of my year even if i didn't exactly ended up searching for songs i've heard through here. actually that's a lie i did search a nokia ringtone orquestra rendition i heard on a random tuesday at 10pm but i couldn't find it. goated as hell. the many times their jazz program has accompanied me during lonely car rides at 1am is just insane.</p>
    <p>in terms of music taste, i think i have stayed pretty much the same as <a href="../2024/">2024</a>. every year i've been finding myself listening to less and less kpop. i think i'm just a bit burnt out by it though there really is some gems to be discovered in that genre of idol music. i will one day remake my playlist page so i can show this to the world. but for now i am just a bit tired of kpop. the biggest jump i did from my usual listening session was probably getting into <b>jane remover</b> because of my girlfriend. other than that, i enjoyed a lot of the same stuff that i tend to enjoy.</p>
    <p>as always, i wished i had listened to more music but hey! at least there is always next time.</p>

      <summary><b>cameo love</b> - tripleS</summary>
      <p>tripleS always has that drum n bass locked the fuck in in that studio it's kind of crazy. i really enjoyed this one from them, lovely voices too.</p>

      <summary><b>baile inolvidable</b> - bad bunny</summary>
      <p>i find it very funny that the only <a href="../../listening-log/2025/index.html">listening log of 2025</a> is... bad bunny's debi tirar mas fotos. but anyway, this song really just mezmerized me from first listen. ESPECIALLY the intro i love the intro so much with those female background vocals and it makes me so MAD when i hear the radio edit of this song because it just straight up skips the intro and goes straight into the song and *EXPLODES*</p>

      <summary><b>dkbk</b> - TAK</summary>
      <p>when i saw that TAK stopped producing kpop songs i got really scared because i thought this meant that he was going to stright up just stop producing. to my luck, this was basically the best thing that happened to me. because it meant i wa free from kpop and now my favorite kpop producer is doing VOCALOID! this was honestly such a happy ending to me... though this song isn't vocaloid. and yet it is my favorite one that he released this year</p>

      <p>my favorite one from jane remover's revengeseekerz. the drop at <code>3:50</code> feels SOOOOOOO good. i feel like this type of music might be like an acquired taste. not something i would listen to all the time but it does hit.</p>

      <p>the <b>chainsaw man reze arc ost</b> had so many bangers, this song makes me Feel the most out of all of them. reminds me a lot of silent hill songs. it's so dark in the begin and yet so delicate as the song continues... and i find it SO AWESOME that the song that i like the most is the one that plays when <span class="spoiler">makima talks to aki about manipulating angel devil</span> oh man... oh man.</p>

    <div class="song">
      <img src="11100011.png" alt="asian glow's 11100011 album cover">
      <p>an album that stayed with me for a while. i really liked how raw this felt with songs like <i>the worst way to start an end</i> and yet at times it would sound so sweet with songs like <i>jitnunkebi</i>. i adore this album very much and i am pretty sure this was the only thing i listed to from jan 2025 - sep 2025.</p>
      <p><b>fav songs:</b> camel8strike, jitnunkebi</p>

    <h3>the deep's kpop b!tch</h3>
    <div class="song">
      <img src="kpop-bitch.png" alt="kpop bitch album cover">
      <p>this might have been the only kpop album that i tuned in into for 2025 and you know what? i am okay with that because this turned out to be such a bangerrrr.</p>
      <p>the sounds that are in these songs are straight out from the 2010's electropop music and oh my god do i miss this kind of music blasting in my ears. i think i even started making a playlist of old songs i used to listen to in middle school because of this album. there's just so much fun to have here!</p>
      <p><b>fav songs:</b> wrong number, lucky star, EDM</p>

    <h3>kensuke ushio's chainsaw man the movie: reze arc - summer's end</h3>
    <div class="song">
      <img src="csm-reze.png" alt="csm reze album cover">
      <p>an amazing soundtrack for an amazing movie. going into this movie i did not expect at all to be blown away by the music BUT I DID IN FACT GET BLOWN AWAY! first of all, the sound design of this movie was simply amazing. even listening to the OST digitally doesn't exactly do it justice compared to how the song are mixed in the movie. but nonetheless, <i>in the pool</i> has to be the prettiest piece of music that i've heard in a while. is so tragic and sweet. when i heard the music glitch out in the theater with <i>sweet danger</i> and later the breakbeats mixed with the strings in <i>dance with chainsaw</i> i was just flabbergasted. this movie was such a treat.</p>

    <h3>uki3's troy</h3>
    <div class="song">
      <img src="troy.png" alt="uki3's troy album cover">
      <p>i got so obsessed with the previous song that i started listening to the entire album one day and MANNNN. it's all so catchy and interesting. some lovely electronic vocaloid songs. the opening song with the MLK SAMPLE caught me very off guard and it's probably the 3rd times that i've heard MLK get sampled in a vocaloid song. okay... either way the album still bangs and i wanted to more into this producer.</p>
      <p><b>fav songs:</b> wendy, dancer in the dark, kyakusyoku</p>

    <h3>balloon & ewe's facsimile</h3>
    <div class="song">
      <img src="facsimile.png" alt="facsimile album cover">
      <p>i find the concept of this album so fucking endearing. it's a collab album between two producers: <b>balloon</b> (who's album <b>corridor</b> i've covered on my <a href="/music/listening-log/2023/09#8">listening log</a> back in 2023) AND our beloved <b>uki3</b> but this time it is under another name of his: <b>ewe</b>. it's basically an album where these two producers re-arrange each other's songs with two new songs from each of them right in the middle of it all. i just love each of the re-arrangements and just how well they fit with one another. i am especially surprised with balloon's re-arrangement of uki3's <i>taikou train</i> in which now it has more of a rock sound to it with the vocaloid being flower this time around and MY GODDDD is this one of the best things i've heard this year. is so packed with energy. which i think got me to eventually listen to the original song. and that original song came from an EP...</p>
      <p><b>fav songs: </b> taikou train arranged balloon, ame to petra arranged uki3, lupus</p>
    </div>

    <h3>uki3/ewe's error EP</h3>
    <div class="song">
      <img src="error-ep.png" alt="error EP album cover">
      <p>AND THIS EP RIGHT HERE was basically the Thing that made me emotionally stable by the end of 2025. i cannot express how beautiful i find this EP. the opening song, <i>error</i> is just magical to me and it makes me feel like i am being teleported into the soundscape of this release. the keyboard sounds at the start with the clicks, there's just something about that that makes me feel so calm. it is pretty much alike to <b>troy</b> but there is still something about it that i just like so much. <i>blood and fish</i> ended up being a song i really liked from here alongside the awesome <i>arazome train</i>. i think this EP just makes me feel a it more emotional, where compared to <b>troy</b> it just makes wanna dance around.</p>
      <p>this made me search more even MORE of his music and i ended up listening to his non-vocaloid music under <u>yoh kamiyama</u>.</p>
      <p><b>fav songs: </b> error, arazome train, blood and fish, resume</p>

    <h3>yoh kamiyama's closet</h3>
    <div class="song">
      <img src="closet.png" alt="yoh kamiyama's closet">
      <p>i can say this def has a different vibe compared to his vocaloid releases but it still keeps a pretty similar sound to what i've grown to love from him. it's like a bit more developed and with a more rock sound intead of heavily electronic. regarless, in this album he shows both sides of this. there's this interlude in the middle of the album called <i>O (until death) YOU</i> that i find so charming. it feels like something taken from the <b>error EP</b> i think it's really sweet seeing vocaloid producers grow so big to the point they start releasing music where they are the ones singing too besides producing the music. and i really do like his voice though it's nothing i haven't heard before. yoh kamiyama really is an amazing producer to me. i've had so much fun with his music and i hope releases more stuff in the future.</p>
