		<p>i had one of these when i was little so i wanted to try doing a JS music player (using sayantanm19's <a href="https://github.com/sayantanm19/js-music-player" target="_blank" class="outlink">js-music-player</a>) that looked as much as the real thing. it was very fun to do tbh! i implemented a little playlist screen in which you can select what song to play.</p>
		<p>it looks best on firefox, but looks okay on chrome. more details about issues can be found on the github repo.</p>

		<p>a fun exercise on CSS animations and to see how close i could get to doing all of this with my current knowledge of JS. inspired by yukika's soul lady album and the passport inclusion! i talk more about it in the preview :3</p>
