      <h2 class="entry"><span class="title">now hosting on nekoweb!</span><span class="date">01.feb.26</span> <span class="weather"><img src="/journal/weather/cloudy.gif" alt="cloudy weather"></span></h2>
      <p>recently <a href="https://nekoweb.org" target="_blank">nekoweb</a> put out a feature that would literally solve my problem of having such a big site with so many pages separate from one another while also having LOTS of pages that have a template format like <a href="/vgs" target="_parent">/video games</a>, <a href="/notebook" target="_parent">/notebook</a>, this very page, and so on. it's really hard to customize these pages because of the separate HTML files, and a few of them are implemented with iframes which i am not the biggest fan of since it prevents me from making them responsive to mobile. i've become pretty comfortable with <a href="https://11ty.dev" target="_blank">11ty</a> <small>(a static site generator which is great for sites with templates)</small> after implementing it completely for my <a href="https://siinamota.doqmeat.com" target="_blank">siinamota fansite</a>. a few weeks ago i tried to set it up for this site and my god. it was just not gonna work out. i was gonna have to structure this site's files completely different in order for <i>11ty</i> to do the thing but i was just not gonna go through the trouble of doing all that.</p>
      <p>i decided to just let it go. maybe in the future i'll make something more manageable for the pages that follow templates, or maybe even start from scratch somewhere else. one day i get the notification that <i>nekoweb</i> released <a href="https://nekoweb.org/ssi" target="_blank">SSI - Server-Side Includes</a> and it works JUST like a SSG would! but now instead of processing my ENTIRE site when there's like maximum 3 folders that need to be rendered, it only processes the files with a <b>layout directive</b> which means that i didn't have to change anything of how my site files are set up. i honestly was so happy when i saw this i literally rushed to change everything up.</p>
      <p>the process of changing hosts wasn't bad at all because now instead of deploying my site through <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-to-neocities" target="_blank">deploy to neocities</a> i use <a href="https://deploy.nekoweb.org/" target="_blank">deploy2nekoweb</a>. i have noticed that this deployment is way slower for the updates to go live than the neocities one. at first i tried to use the official <a href="https://nekoweb.org/git" target="_blank">nekogit</a> with the local git instance i use for my website but even when i was uploading my site in chunks (there's a limit of 100mb per commit) i would still get an error because the upload went past 100mbs. i have a feeling this is because my .git folder is like... 600mbs from all the objects (commits and logs) it has. i don't really wanna clear this folder out since i am often going back to older versions of my site. i'll try to see if i can work around this with my other sites.</p>
      <p>the first page i implemented the <i>SSI</i> was for <a href="/info" target="_parent">/info</a> where i keep information about my site and archives of it. that page really needed a nice rework so i went with a window style using the <a href="https://catppuccin.com/" target="_blank">catppuccin</a> color palette. something i really enjoy of <i>SSI</i> is that you can easily use blocks in your files that will go to separate places in your layout. i just googled how to do that in 11ty without using frontmatter and i did find an answer but it's not as straight forward as how <i>SSI</i> implements it. with this, if i ever need to update the layout, then i would only need to update that file instead of going through every HTML and changing the code one by one. the only downside is that you can't really preview the layouts locally like you would with a SSG but it is something i can live without.</p>
      <p>the next pages i wanna implement this feature would be the journal that you're currently reading... pray for me because i need to get through 3 years of logs. oh my goodness. so that will take a bit of time</p>
      <p>what would happen if i ever wanna move out of nekoweb? well... then i think that would be my call to implement something else for these pages. i'm currently taking <b>databases</b> in university which is a class i've been wanting to take for a while so i can learn about SQL and implement a database with users and such for my <a href="https://siinamota.doqmeat.com/fanlisting">siinamota fanlisting</a> instead of adding the members manually. if i get really comfortable with it, i can see myself implementing a database for doqmeat.com for my media logs, maybe even make my own chatbox or comments under pages, and such but only time will tell.</p>

      <p>so speaking in terms of progression, the move from <b>neocities</b> was going to happen at some point. there's also other stuff about <b>nekoweb</b> that i really like. the premium tier that i'm currently paying for is at $3.20 while with neocities i was paying $5. sometimes i would delete site previews because i didn't really do any meaningful changes to my site. <b>nekoweb</b> feels really promising with it's features but really that's about it for me. they both feel pretty much the same for me.</p>
      <p>with all that said, <a href="https://doqmeat.neocities.org" target="_blank">doqmeat.neocities.org</a> will stay up until <b>neocities</b> dies. it simply redirects you to my domain: <mark>doqmeat.com</mark> and if someone uses the neocities subdomain to access a page (example: <mark>doqmeat.neocities.org/about</mark>) i wrote a very simple script in the 404 page where it will redirect you to <mark>doqmeat.com/about</mark>. my updates will obviously not show up on the feed anymore but i will keep visiting <b>neocities</b> to check out my feed every once in a while and explore new sites. i love the community here very much and moving to another host won't really change that. oh and i'm not really big on follower numbers but 2k followers on neocities is kinda crazy for me. my site has reached so many people... really, thank you all! if you mostly checked out my updates through the neocities feed, then i really recommend to follow my <a href="/rss.xml">RSS feed</a> which is a more reliable way of getting notified of any meaningful updates i make. if you have no clue what an RSS feed is i really recommend to check out an <a href="/notebook/tutorials/rss/index.html" target="_parent">RSS guide</a> i made!</p>
      <p>so basically the main take away from this post should be to please make RSS feeds for your websites so where ever you go on the internet people can still find out what's new. i love getting notified when a website i like gets updated instead of scrolling through a feed where i have to fuck around and find out. peace and love.</p>
