      <p>what a year has 2025 been! it definitely felt a bit more busy than 2024. felt like i got involved in more stuff too! i learned quite a few things about myself and the relationships i have with people.</p>
      <p>i had a lot of fun in my university last year. i feel like i spent more time in campus than in my very own place. from grinding my calculus class, learning cool stuff i've been able to apply to my website in my computer science classes, and even getting involved in my uni's computer science department. hell, i even did a <a title="my blog post about it" href="https://desteny.me/posts/css-workshop" target="_blank" class="outlink">CSS workshop</a> for the association i'm in!</p>
      <p>met lots of new people, made lots of new friends, and a couple of close ones as well. i noticed i've been a bit more open to talking to new people. been getting a bit outside of my comfort zone as of late doing things while my heart is going at 100bpm. my public speaking skills have gotten a little bit better too. my voice doesn't shake as much and i think i've been able to sound more fluently. something i still have to work on is eye contact with my public. i get extremely nervous when talking in public so there's still things to improve. and there always is something to improve on!</p>
      <p>making new friends made me realize how much i miss having connections with people. it always surprises me when i notice that people think about me and remember me. i still consider myself a bit of a introvert at heart, i enjoy being alone, but i also enjoy having a laugh with people that i love. at the end of the year i told a classmate of mine that i was very happy to have been talking to her more this semester. i don't give a fuck anymore. because either way, she said <q>same</q>! life is so much more fun when you aren't afraid to love and get close to people. basically i live by this tweet i saw recently:</p>
      <center><img src="imgs/0107-twt.png" alt="a twitter post that reads: some of you forget that life is about having #fun and being #kind" style="max-style:100%"></center>
      <p>outside of uni, i traveled quite a bit last year with my <a title="blog post" href="/blog/2025/summer-trip/" target="_parent">summer trip</a> to florida in july and my trip to <a title="uploaded a couple of pics of my trip to my photobook" href="/photobook" target="_parent">arizona</a> in december. i really like traveling, but doing it with a limited income and a cat to take care of is kinda hard so i probably won't get on any airplanes this year.</p>
      <p>played a couple of games. despite not beating any of them, i still have had a lot of fun playing them. was able to buy a PS5 with some saved money which made me get into <a href="/vgs/games/infinity-nikki/">infinity nikki</a> and return to overwatch. my go-to online game was <i>infinity nikki</i>! but i have yet to complete the single player games i have on the console like <a href="/vgs/games/bloodborne/" target="_parent">bloodborne</a> and <i>hollow knight silksong</i>. i would have loved to play more and complete them last year but really i just haven't had the time / mood to play them <img src="/!g/pix/sad.gif" alt="sad emoji">. same as the <a href="/vgs/games/fallout-new-vegas/" target="_parent">fallout new vegas DLCs</a> which i want to complete before jumping into the world of <i>fallout 2</i>. i don't really like rushing video games so that is something i have to be okay with.</p>
      <p>for 2026 i wish to be a bit more kinder to myself, feel less shame in doing things that are very normal, go on more walks, cultivate better friendships, and have more confidence in me <img src="/!g/pix/happy1.gif" alt="happy emoji"> and the things that i do. i also want other <a title="my 2025 scrapbook with some goals for 2026" href="/scrapbook/2025#review" target="_parent">things</a> but those are the most important ones when it comes to myself.</p>
      <p>happy <small>late</small> new years everyone!</p>
