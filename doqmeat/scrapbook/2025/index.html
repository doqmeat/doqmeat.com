          lowkey nothing burger movie. built a pretty decent suspense but ??? idk i feel like it never really did anything with it. the age gap is there for a reason and this movie does show how manipulative and dangerous these relationships can be but again. ? idk i just feel like not much happened here tbh. very pretty to look at though.

          you know how they say curiosity killed the cat? yeah that's what happened. it honestly gets two stars because i laughed at some jokes like "my dad said math got debunked", the villager love story side plot (though it was so horrific to look at him), and chungus (please don't ever make me type that word again) whole character. overall just horrible slop as expected.

          this was a mega whatever movie in terms of the plot. probably one of the weakest ones from the conjuring as well. but (hopefully) its a nice send off for the saga. i say hopefully cus you always see them making another one even after saying the previous one was the last movie.
