				<p><b>04.aug.24 - 10pm</b> i kinda wanna redo my homepage so i've been working on that, but i'm not sure what exactly to do with it!! i know i would like to make it a bit lighter for those with slow connections (like me) and i wanna move my fanlistings and webrings into a separate page too. i might go for something a bit more minimalist? not sure but i would also like to mess around with colors and have different themes for it. we will see!</p>

				<p><b>31.jul.24 - 3pm</b> did a bit of javascript stuff today! learned how to use <code>localStorage</code> and implemented it on my <a href="/blog">blog</a> for the light / dark theme switcher. took me a bit bc the result would end up being <code>null</code> if it was your first time visiting that page so i just simply did a <i>if null do "light theme"</i> and it worked so that's going to be like that until i can learn to do it another way. i also figured i could rewrite the random music ad script on my <a href="/music">music</a> page in a more coherent and efficent way than the one shown from the template i took. <button onclick="showPic('!g/240731-js.jpg','screenshot of code editor','like look at this mess')">!g/240731-js.jpg</button></p>

				<p><b>08.jul.24 - 7pm</b> just messed aroung a little bit with <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/" target="_blank" class="outlink">eleventy</a> for a bit thanks to this <a href="https://whiona.weblog.lol/2023/10/my-neocities-workflow:-using-eleventy-and-the-cli-to-speed-up-development" title="My Neocities workflow: using Eleventy and the CLI to speed up development by Whiona" target="_blank" class="outlink">guide</a> by <a href="https://whiona.me/" target="_blank" class="outlink">whiona.me</a>. i can see it coming in pretty handy for some cases, but i think <small>as mentioned in the guide!</small> i won't be getting much use of it since i like to add minor decorations and such to pages where <i>i could</i> use it like my <a href="/vgs">gaming log</a>, <a href="/blog">blog</a>, and <a href="/journal">journal</a>. but either way it's cool that i learned something new.</p>
