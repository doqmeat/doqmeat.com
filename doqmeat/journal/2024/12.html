      <h2 class="entry"><span class="title">1st year of uni done!</span><span class="date">17.dec.24</span></h2>
      <p>i am FREEEEEE from my 2nd uni semester today! these past 2 weeks have felt like A LOT to me because of all the things i've had to do + keeping up with people doing holiday shopping at my work. i'm currently sick which is not very great but whatever. it will pass through before christmas hopefully. i really need to mask up at my work place because last month i also got sick... and now i'm sick once again <img src="/!g/pix/catbored.gif" alt=""></p>
      <p><b>today was my final exam for my precalculus 2 class.</b> that exam was ROUGH... and that is from someone who has studied a lot for this class and gotten from 98% to 100% on my previous class exams. but i'm also like WHATEVER. i found it difficult to study a lot for it because of how many hours i've been doing at my job lately. at the end of the day, i know i passed that class and thats really all that matters. yay <img src="/!g/pix/heart4.png" alt=""></p>
      <p>thank god my <b>computer science final exam was a take home one</b> and you could do it with a classmate in pairs! i did it yesterday with a <a title="i've talked about how i met him here!" href="09.html#27.2">friend</a> i had made throughout the semester. sometimes i hang out with people and i'm like <q>oh that's right i do like to talk and hang around and laugh with people</q> <img src="/!g/pix/skull.gif"> maybe i'm just very picky... because i feel like i get really drained in the usual social setting. i'm not really a social butterfly but i have been trying to talk to more people while i attend uni. so i'm happy that at the end of the day i was able to meet some cool ones and befriend them! it's kinda amazing how math brings some people together.</p>
      <p>i have a few <b>things planned for my free time</b> this coming month. here's a list for convenience:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>finish <i>fallout new vegas</i>, get DLCs through the steam winter sale.</li>
        <li>finish <i>kirby planet robobot</i></li>
        <li>fix PS4</li>
        <li>make new page that resembles my old mp3 player</li>
        <li>keep working on siinamota <a href="https://siinamota.doqmeat.com" target="_blank">fansite</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>will probably talk more about my PS4 on another log but good lord. what a struggle. i hate sony.</p>
      <p>i also got interviewed by maren bell for an <a href="https://coldcuts.neocities.org/writing1">article</a> about neocities and social media and it got published recently! it's awesome to see other sites that i visit participate in this as well <img src="/!g/pix/catupndown.gif" alt=""></p>

   <p>if you've read some of my <a href="/vgs/bloodborne/index.html" target="_blank">bloodborne</a> or past journal logs. you will already know that it's been quite a bit since i've used my ps4, lets do a bit of a recap.</p>
   <p>around august 2023, my ps4's bluetooth / wifi antenna started freaking out. i had noticed this because my internet and later on my controller would sometimes disconnect for no reason. i started using an ethernet cable but a week after that my controller did not want to connect at all. i searched online and figured that the antenna was damaged.</p>
   <h3>replace antenna</h3>
   <p>i went through the trouble of replacing the antenna. this was a while back so i don't remember much. but it was pretty simple though. the thing is that... this didn't do anything. i tried to connect the controller. and nothing.</p>
   <p>i eventually figured that i could just get an actual WIRED controller. but i didn't go searching for one since i was studying + i didn't have a job back then.</p>
   <h3>get a data micro usb cable</h3>
   <p>if you've ever had a dualshock 4 (the name of the PS4 controller) you will know that it charges with a micro usb. back then i had read A LOT that if the cable wasn't a data cable too then you would have trouble connecting the controller. pretty recently i managed to get one through ebay SUPER cheap after seeing it on best buy.</p>
   <p>this did not work either.....</p>
   <p>on my reddit searchings i stumble upon a piece of information that i think made me cartoonishly red out of anger once i read and tried it. when booting up the PS4, you are able to go into a <i>safe mode</i> menu with some options. kinda like booting up to the bios of a computer. when in this menu... it asks you to plug in the controller. and you know what :) the controller works just fine there! BUT NOT WHEN I WANT TO USE MY ACTUAL PS4 THOUGH!!!!!</p>
   <p>i learned that in this <i>safe mode</i> the PS4 Can Indeed Connect via a DATA CABLE without the need of using it's bluetooth. and for some reason, when you normally boot up the console, it will Always try to connect via bluetooth. even if the controller is being connected via cable. this pissed me off so fucking much. like why. if its capable of doing such a thing then why woud you only let it work in a secret hidden menu. die.</p>
   <h3>it's actually the chip</h3>
   <p>surprise surprise! with the antenna being just replaced. and with the confirmation that my ps4 can indeed recognize controllers via USB, that meant that the wifi/bluetooth chip</p>
