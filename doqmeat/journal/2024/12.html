      <h2 class="entry"><span class="title">1st year of uni done!</span><span class="date">17.dec.24</span></h2>
      <p>i am FREEEEEE from my 2nd uni semester today! these past 2 weeks have felt like A LOT to me because of all the things i've had to do + keeping up with people doing holiday shopping at my work. i'm currently sick which is not very great but whatever. it will pass through before christmas hopefully. i really need to mask up at my work place because last month i also got sick... and now i'm sick once again <img src="/!g/pix/catbored.gif" alt=""></p>
      <p><b>today was my final exam for my precalculus 2 class.</b> that exam was ROUGH... and that is from someone who has studied a lot for this class and gotten from 98% to 100% on my previous class exams. but i'm also like WHATEVER. i found it difficult to study a lot for it because of how many hours i've been doing at my job lately. at the end of the day, i know i passed that class and thats really all that matters. yay <img src="/!g/pix/heart4.png" alt=""></p>
      <p>thank god my <b>computer science final exam was a take home one</b> and you could do it with a classmate in pairs! i did it yesterday with a <a title="i've talked about how i met him here!" href="09.html#27.2">friend</a> i had made throughout the semester. sometimes i hang out with people and i'm like <q>oh that's right i do like to talk and hang around and laugh with people</q> <img src="/!g/pix/skull.gif"> maybe i'm just very picky... because i feel like i get really drained in the usual social setting. i'm not really a social butterfly but i have been trying to talk to more people while i attend uni. so i'm happy that at the end of the day i was able to meet some cool ones and befriend them! it's kinda amazing how math brings some people together.</p>
      <p>i have a few <b>things planned for my free time</b> this coming month. here's a list for convenience:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>finish <i>fallout new vegas</i>, get DLCs through the steam winter sale.</li>
        <li>finish <i>kirby planet robobot</i></li>
        <li>fix PS4</li>
        <li>make new page that resembles my old mp3 player</li>
        <li>keep working on siinamota <a href="https://siinamota.doqmeat.com" target="_blank">fansite</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>will probably talk more about my PS4 on another log but good lord. what a struggle. i hate sony.</p>
      <p>i also got interviewed by maren bell for an <a href="https://coldcuts.neocities.org/writing1">article</a> about neocities and social media and it got published recently! it's awesome to see other sites that i visit participate in this as well <img src="/!g/pix/catupndown.gif" alt=""></p>
