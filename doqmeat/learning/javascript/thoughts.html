		<h2 id="thoughts">my thoughts as i learn</h2>
		<p id="helena-4th-anni">it's kind of crazy how much my uni classes have helped me so much with my progress in JS. and it's all thanks to C++. thank you C++! i think C++ is pretty cool but this isn't about her, this is about JS. i think my overall use / knowledge of JS has increased quite a bit but i still need some tips and stuff on how to structure my JS code better. i think right now one of my biggest milestones have been getting a better understanding of how the <code>eventListeners</code> work. i mostly used them on a page i made for me and my gf's 4th anniversary (which if i ever upload, it will be as a template or something) and another page where you have to make 2 fish kiss. i wanted to make these pages as interactive as possible while also having to make them simple because of FINALS and uni projects i haven't finished.</p>

			<figcaption>screenshot of the main page where you have to click on letters and it will reveal different stuff</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>i wanted something like having a bunch of letters scattered across the page and have my gf open them. when you click an envelope a little sound effect will appear which i know will make her smile. originally i wanted it to be a bunch of letters and while trying to figure it how i could get the different sound effects on different envelopes i was thinking to myself <q>damn if only i could do <a title="(visual example of what nth-of-type does)" href="https://codepen.io/doqmeat/pen/ByajzJZ?editors=1100" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nth-of-type</a> on JS...</q> <b>AND THEN IT FUCKING HIT ME</b>.</p>
		<p>at the moment my current <i>computer science</i> related classes that i'm taking this semester are <i>discrete math</i> and <i>data structures</i>. i love you data structures but this isn't about you either. everything is about <b>discrete math</b>. you see... during discrete math when we started talking about the <b>algorithm of division</b>, i was often seen this syntax: <mark>n = DQ + R</mark>, n being some number, D being the divisor, Q being the quotient, and R being the remainder after dividing. when i got to this part of the class i started noticing that THAT syntax was pretty similar to the one i use in CSS for <code>:nth-of-type</code>. for example. if i have a bunch of HTML elements and i wanted to make every 2 elements different colors, then i'd do so with <wbr> <code>element:nth-of-type(2n + 0)</code> and <code>element:nth-of-type(2n + 1)</code> and at the time i didn't really get how it works but i just knew that it worked. fast-forward a little bit and now we are talking about the remainder of when you do a division, called the <b>modulo operation</b> aka this thing <code>%</code> in various programming languages. and by this point it was when it clicked. when you divide something by 2 (as i did in my example), for every number it will only have two options for the remainder (aka mod). <code>N (N being any number) % 2</code> will only output either 0 or 1, it will only output <bold>2</bold> different numbers! 0 and 1! and if you do <code>N % 30</code> this will only be able to output 30 different numbers! from 0 all the way to 29. and that's when this realization hit me.</p>
		<p>what <code>element:nth-of-type(An + B)</code> does is that is taking the amount of elements and doing a mod operation on them so each element can have a <b>repeating</b> pattern, the number of times that the pattern will repeat is being decided by <b>A</b>, if A = 4, then you can have <b>up to four</b> different <b>B</b>'s so the pattern can follow. because it can ONLY have 2 options! <b>BECAUSE OF THE ALGORITHM OF DIVISION. I LOVE LIFE.</b> this meant that it was taking the amount of elements (n) and doing a modulus operation on them with whatever A you had to determine the pattern, in other words: n % A = B.</p>
		<p>SO back to my original problem: i have an array of sound effects that i wanted to use on my array of envelopes, so different sounds would play whenever you clicked on a different envelope. by thinking about nth-of-type, i was able to conclude that all i needed to to was calculate the current envelope element i was clicking and do a mod operation with the amount of sound effects i had on the array. i made a function for this so the math ended up looking like this: <code>playSFX(envelope_index % sfx.length)</code>. this would get me either 0 or 1, which are the indexes i need to access each of the elements in the array sfx.</p>
		<p style="font-size:2rem;line-height:normal">damn discrete math is kinda fucking cool.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="!g/251207-fishlove.jpg" alt="screenshot of the fish love next to some javascript code">
			<figcaption>screenshot of another page where you have to make 2 fish kiss. <u>11.dec.25 edit:</u> the <a href="/fish-love">fish love</a> page is now available!</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>then the next page titled <i>fish love</i> is exactly about that. trying to make 2 fish kiss... using extensive use of <code>eventListeners</code> for the drag and drop. the base code for the draggable elements is from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14695933/draggable-div-with-classname" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stackoverflow</a>! and i did a lot of minor tweaks for it to work for what i needed it to. i think it was pretty cool that once i got the fish moving my next step was <q>okay and now how do we know they are kissing?</q> <u>basic math baby!</u> or at least i'm pretty sure it is... either way i wasnt born for math so i still had to take out a paper and pen and start drawing the grid and the fish boxes so i could see what had to be done and it birthed this AWESOME function that checks if the fish are kissing.</p>
		<textarea style="height:100px">
function checkKiss() {
	let fish1Area = fishLeft.offsetLeft + fishLeft.offsetWidth;
	let fishX = fish1Area - fishRight.offsetLeft;
	let fishY = Math.abs(fishLeft.offsetTop - fishRight.offsetTop);
	return fishX >= 0 && fishX <= 10 && fishY >= 0 && fishY <= 5;
}
</textarea>
		<p>because of this, i needed the absolute value of a number in order to determine if the fish were kissing by calculating their difference between their <code>offsetTop</code> so i also found out about the function that gives you the absolute value of a number: <code>Math.abs(n)</code>. pretty cool!</p>
		<p>for now have my ramblings, but at a later date i will upload this stuff here after i show my girlfriend :3</p>
		<p><b>25.dec.25 UPDATE:</b> the page has been up for a while now but <a href="/fish-love/">fish love</a> is now live on my site.</p>

		<p>i never really talked about the <a href="https://doqmeat.github.io/js-walkman-mp3-player/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mp3 player</a> i made using a <a href="https://github.com/sayantanm19/js-music-player" target="_blank">JS template</a> so lets do that now!! making this little thing was so much fun. the template code was just for the music player with a tracking slider, and a volume one (wait i should implement the volume slider as buttons on the side... i'll add it to the to-do list) but that was pretty much it! i added the playlist and more properties to the song objects like the genre and year it was released. also added a few tiny stuff like some conditionals for the little bar at the bottom. overall really fun to work with!</p>

		<p>i find it kinda weird that the <a href="https://javascript.info" target="_blank" class="outlink">guide</a> i am using for JS doesn't use <code>console.log</code> at all and instead uses <code>alert()</code> which i know it's doing the same thing bit idk i feel like the console telling me whatever it needs to tell me is WAYYYY more useful than seeing it pop up in a alert. BUT NONETHELESS i've been really digging this guide because i feel with other tutorials that i was using they weren't very focused on the user Really understand the fundamentals behind the programming language. but so far i've been having a nice time reading and doing the practice tasks by myself. it really takes me back to my <i>intro to programming</i> class, and i really like that it's kind of a refresher in that sense as well! win win. i'm currently in the <i>objects</i> section which is definitely where the unknown territories of JS (for me) are staring to popup. i think something very interesting i've learned about have been <mark>arrow functions</mark>. very neat!</p>
		<p>ALSO this whole time i had been wondering if there was a way to get the console log on my VSC without having to live preview an HTML file that had the current script i'm working on. recently i found out about the extension called <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WallabyJs.quokka-vscode" target="_blank" class="outlink">quokka.js</a> and it literally changed my life for quick testing JS variables and such.</p>

		<p>so far i've managed to do a couple of things around my site, i introduced a dialog box when clicking the chatbox tab and it asks you to agree to the rules. i was originally going to do it with an <code>alert()</code> but then i later found out about <code>confirm()</code> which is PERFECT for what i wanted to do. also learned i can do a custom one using the <code>dialog</code> element so in the future i'll get to that :p <a title="github source code" href="https://github.com/doqmeat/doqmeat.com/blob/main/doqmeat/!f/v5/script.js#L45" target="_blank" class="outlink">code snippet</a></p>
		<p>i've also found a way to iterate through the years using the javascript <code>Date()</code> constructor <small>need to look up this term later...</small> so i don't have to write the same piece of coding every year for my microblog! also cleaned up the code a bit so it's easier to use for me. you can see the changes for all of that <a title="github commit diff" href="https://github.com/doqmeat/doqmeat.com/commit/4f99cd5cef3b42988b7089074761adeb8ce285a5#diff-deafc4cb713ec8a76a49ac6ef62c1c023c326730b300588fcfd8f171030e0a9e" target="_blank" class="outlink">here</a>. it kind of gives me an idea for my <a href="/journal">journal</a> page for the calendar iframe but... i'm not sure if i'll go with it at the end of the day. we will see!</p>
		<p>been also writing more comments on my JS files. it really is nice when you go back to them and know wtf each thing does. thank you professor.</p>

		<hr>
		<p>my class <i>introduction to programming</i> (which focuses on c++) is kinda doing wonders for all the things that i've done with JS without really knowing WHY they worked the way they did... i'm also currently reading <i>JavaScript All-in-One For Dummies</i> which i had saved in a pdf from god knows where. i think my previous knowledge + my class is making the first few chapters of this kinda of a breeze but wow!!! i have learned so many little things about JS so far that i didn't know about. been mostly reading it on the train so i have a few notes of stuff i want to practice and write about on this page once i have some more free time. but at least for me, i think <mark>it is way easier to get all of this new information from a book</mark> rather then a documentation site (w3schools, mozilla, etc. etc.) it def makes the process of learning these things way less intimidating.</p>
		<p class="date">05.mar.25</p>
		<hr>
		<p>learned how to remove classes and add them with an event like so:</p>
		<textarea style="height:90px"> for (i = 0; i < buttons.length; i++) {
    buttons[i].classList.remove("active");
  }
  event.currentTarget.className += " active";</textarea>
		<p>still need to dig deeper into events because as i was coding this on VSC, i kept getting a warning saying that <code>event</code> was deprecated but then my question was... then how do i do this? </p>
		<hr>
		<p>in my compsci class we've been talking about operators like <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>not</code> which helped me out a bit when making my <a href="/fashion">fashion</a> page's javascript! in this case i used the <code>or</code> which is written like this <code>||</code> in JS for an if statement so that the mobile/responsive view of the page could be as neat as possible. honestly it was pretty fun to figure that out and get it working. i really need to look more into what <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget" target="_blank">event targets</a> are though.</p>
		<hr>
		<p>the <a href="https://doqmeat.github.io/HTML-templates/yukika/script.js" target="_blank">javascript</a> for my yukika passport is SOO messy but it does work! i am SURE there's probably a whole other way of doing this but i haven't quite gotten there yet.</p>
		<hr>
		<p>figured out how to do a box pop up and a img modal of sorts! i put a class tag on all that imgs where if you click them then i take the <code>src</code> and <code>alt</code> text into the img modal. you can check it out on the scans page of my <a title="currently a WIP!" href="https://siinamota.doqmeat.com/scans/" target="_blank" class="outlink">siinamota fansite</a>. i also use a similar thing for the imgs on my <a href="/microblog">microblog</a> but with a different method.</p>
		<p>also learning how to use this bit of code with the examples mentioned above <br><code>i = 0; i &lt; example.length; i++</code></p>
		<hr>

		<select>
			<option selected>what style should the box be???</option>
			<option onclick="toggleDark()">dark</option>
			<option onclick="toggleCat()">cat</option>
		</select>

		<div id="box">
			<p>hi this is inside a box! </p>
			<p>this is a <a href="/">link</a>. this is <b>bolded</b>. this is <i>italics</i>. this is <mark>highlighted</mark></p>
		</div>

		<hr>

		<p>note: i am still wrapping my head around the difference between <code>==</code> and <code>===</code> when i used it for a toggle like this. but i'm starting to understand some stuff!!!</p>
