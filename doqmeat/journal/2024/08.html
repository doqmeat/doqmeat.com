			<h1 class="entry"><span class="title">storm update + compsci class</span><span class="date">22.aug.24</span> <span class="weather"><img src="/journal/weather" alt=""></span></h1>
			<p><b>as an update to my previous log</b>, luckily the storm didn't do much to my area. which i am very grateful for. the power didn't even go out! which was a complete surprise for me. because you know what? i am currently typing this with no electricity in my apartment. you truly never know in here. thank you to the people who sent me messages wanting me to stay safe. funnily enough, the same day the storm passed i had a shift at work and the store wasn't closed? which is so crazy to me. despite having to work, it was pretty chill because there was almost no customers at all in the store and because of that i got to do my favorite thing in the world of retail: shelving and organizing merchandise. not a single customer talked to me that day. i was really living the dream.</p>
			<p>after uni classes getting delayed because the storm: this week i started my august semester at uni with <i>precalculus 2</i> and <i>introduction to computer science</i>.</p>
			<p>of course, my compsci class is the one that i've been the most excited about! i think over the past year i have been working towards this very moment. my very first compsci class after taking an interest in it. i've only taken 2 classes, but so far i really like the professor's vibe. which personally, i think it is like top 3 most important things about a uni class ever. so far i've been pretty lucky with my professors, to be fair. but ANYWAY, my compsci professor actually takes his dog to class. EVERY class. and i find that so charming. he just lets him hang around the classroom. during the first 10 minutes, he just goes around sniffing people and then the rest of the class he just sleeps. the wonders of being a dog.</p>

			<p>besides the cool af dog, i do like the dynamic of his class so far. the programming language we are gonna work is python, which i have 0 experience with but that's okay because i am here to learn <img src="/!g/pix/smileyface.gif" alt=""> today he went over the most basics of things like what a variable is, how to assign it Something, how to make a list, how to access an element in the list using an index numbers.</p>
			<p>now, i might know <b>nothing</b> about python, but i kind of already know (at least surface level) about these things thanks to javascript. it's pretty neat that my self-learning of javascript will actually help me out a bit on my compsci class so i won't be completely lost, or overwhelmed. at least the first month. he also asked if anyone had experience using the terminal and i was the only one who raised their hand <img src="/!g/pix/emote1emba.gif" alt=""> during our first day we also got to introduce ourselves so people already know that i am taking that class because it interested me while learning how to code web pages. so when i raised my hand for the terminal question, he asked if it was for the HTML i've been doing and i was like yeah... idk why but i feel a bit embarrassed showing that i already know how some of this stuff works. but you know what? it also feels nice :) but not in a <q>HA, i know more than you!</q> type way. but like i said before, it's nice that i'm already a bit familiarized with these things. it's like me studying google maps before driving to a new place. it's just nice to have that.</p>
			<p>in other news: yesterday i went to <b>watch coraline in theaters</b> in 3D because it was it's 15th anniversary! it was honestly a magical experience to experience this movie in 3D. i just wish we had gotten better seats bc we had to sit pretty close to the screen and we were a bit to the side so my neck was killing me for a little bit, but i still think it was mega worth it.</p>
			<p><img src="!g/240822-ed.jpg" alt="streetpass plaza pic" width="50%" align="left" style="margin:10px;">i also got <b>my first streetpass tag</b> since i revived my 3DS this june. so thank you Ed for being my first streetpass since then! i hope i get more streetpasses around uni.</p>

			<h1 class="entry"><span class="title">tropical storm</span><span class="date">13.aug.24</span> <span class="weather"><img src="/journal/weather/cloudy.gif" alt=""></span></h1>
			<p>my first week of classes was supposed to be this very week but because of the incoming storm, they have been canceled. which i am a bit sad about because i was really looking forward to seeing the friend i made from my past precalculus class! and also, i just miss taking the train and being at my uni.</p>
			<p>it is 12pm as of typing this, and the storm should arrive on wednesday, august 14 at 2am. classes should start again on thursday but given how fragile our power grid is, i highly doubt it i'll be back in uni this week. i don't think the storm should be <b>that</b> bad, so maybe i'll just be 1-3 days without electricity.</p>
			<p>yesterday, i went out to make my preparations. my apartment is not in the best conditions. <mark>the ceiling leaks</mark> AND <mark>my kitchen and living room starts flooding whenever it rains a lot</mark>. this might honestly be the reason why i'm able to afford it. but besides that, it's not a bad place to live in. anyways, due to the reasons mentioned above, i bought some more buckets for the ceiling leaks so i can stop using bowls and pans for that, and i also got some of those table party plastic covers to cover some of my stuff. in case it starts leaking in a new place where there's stuff underneath it.</p>
			<p>now, for the flooding... there is not much i can do about that. i already have some towels on the floor on the places that usually start to flood, which makes it easier to control it. but this storm will be arriving at 2am. i do not plan on staying up til the sun rises mopping my entire apartment. because i'm aware of the flooding problems of this apartment, i do not have any wooden furniture touching the floor, or really anything that shouldn't get wet on the floor <small>(self reminder to get roomba and cables off the floor)</small>. so i basically plan to chill on my bed and try to get a good sleep, that way, i can just start mopping when i get up. the flooding is mostly just fucking annoying. but like i said, i don't think any of my stuff will get damaged because of it <small>(self reminder 2: pick rug off floor)</small> and because its just a tropical storm. i don't think the water will even get to my ankle. well let's hope.</p>
			<p>i think i'll be alright here nonetheless. besides the buckets, i also bought a tiny battery fan, which will be SO SO SO useful with the insane heat that has been happening lately. i will probably shower more than 3 times per day (without power) to refresh myself. i have a solid amount of food and i also have some ice and coolers in which i can store my food so it doesn't go bad on the fridge. i will have my laptop, switch, 3DS, phone, other phone, charged up along side some battery banks so like i am all good there. though during times like these, i mostly just sleep it off. in order to save charge on my electronics and all of that. and also to save myself of the annoyance of having to be awake in such a hot weather.</p>
			<p>i haven't mopped in a while so at least my kitchen and living will get a crazy good mop afterwards! good for them! good for them.</p>
			<p>the lights are flickering as i'm typing this <img src="/!g/pix/skull.gif" alt=""></p>
			<p>ANYWAYYYY to end this off, i've been through a cat 5 hurricane so like with the knowledge and trauma from that, i'm pretty sure i will be okay. and of course with all that said, do expect some inactivity from me. take care everyone!</p>
