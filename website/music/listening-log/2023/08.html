			<p>okay confession time: <mark>when i listened to this on release. i was not very sold on it....</mark></p>
			<p>i genuinely dont remember if i was in a really bad mood <img src="https://doqmeat.neocities.org/!g/pix/skull.gif"> or what but i DID NOT like this a lot. but i think i knew i had to let it "marinate" a bit because some songs here sound like something i would go <mark>crazy</mark> for. 
			<p>for example: the drum and bass in <i>speed love</i> is so awesome and I DID think it was  really good on my first listen but i still felt like something was missing....</p>
			<p>but yeah <mark>i listened to this EP again and i enjoyed it</mark> (and appreciate it) way more now. hmm. i think my problem was that i had really high expectations for this. because Most of these songs are pretty damn great. they are catchy, they are funky. i'll still ignore <i>cry baby</i> and pretend kpop is past the pop rock b-side trend. but the rest of this EP is really nice! idk what i was expecting tbh LOL. because <i>seoul sonyo sound</i> and <i>complexity</i> are pretty crazy on their own and so up my alley
			<p>maybe i just felt like being a hater that day, i wonder why</p>
			<p>also i just noticed how <i>&amp;#8586</i> is the continuation of  <i>chowall</i> from <b>assemble</b>, and a personal fav from that EP. very nice touch. <s>yes i just noticed their outros tease future tracks ha ha</s></p>

			<p>wow <mark>what a TREAT is it to look at this music video!!!!</mark> this is so gorgeous to me <small>i was wondering if i should put this on my journal log or here since im not really talking about the song itself? in here but fuck it</small></p>
			<p>i love love love the colors of this so much and it just has such an amazing composition too. it was directed by japanese illustrator / animator <a class="outlink" href="https://twitter.com/ligton1225" target="_blank">ligton</a>. While going through their twitter i saw that they work at MAPPA and even <a class="outlink" title="twitter link" href="https://twitter.com/ligton1225/status/1602987923049259009?s=20" target="_blank">worked on the chainsaw man anime</a> which was awesome to see since i loved the animation of CSM so much.</p>
			<p>but besides talking about the animation, i found the story super beautiful. its pretty simple. two girls find each other randomly and have the time of their lives together. but one of the girls gets scared at how close they've grown together. but again, the animation just does such a fantastic job at portraying these emotions and feelings and i swear i let a tear fall when i finished watching it cus i got emotional?!?!? <mark>and its kinda (VERY) gay too!</mark> <img src="https://doqmeat.neocities.org/!g/pix/cathappy.gif"> YAY! i fucking love gay girls so much shoutout to them fr</p>
			<p>closing thoughts: i will eventually listen to the EP this song is from. i did really like the song too!!! its very fun and it's prob something i'll put on my playlist. i also really like that very subtle 2-step beat that it has and the synths? in the chorus are a very nice touch. honestly kind of a lowkey banger from eve since most of his songs dont really stick with me despite liking them a Normal amount. oh and the intro reminds me a lot of one <a class="outlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pv56oBAfRhY" target="_blank">my fav songs</a> from eve: <i>退屈を再演しないで</i></p>
			 <p>but today i just wanted to talk about the MV of eve's <i>kororon</i>. awesome. thank you to ligton and everyone else that worked on this music video for blessing my eyes</p>

			<p>i've had this EP in my "to listen tos" for such a while because of that time spotify's discover weekly came in clutch and recommended me <i>MOOGCiTY</i>. i went so crazy when i first heard this. minecraft and DRUM AND BASS?!?!? oh hell yeah!!!!!</p>
			<p>i feel like this is just like a compilation of remixes tho? each track (with the exception of the last one) also feature parts of vocaloid songs. which, dont get me wrong, its cool af!! and i know these genres are mostly heavy of the sampling part but it just kinda feels like a remixes release rather than its own thing, you know?</p>
			<p>but besides that thought, <mark>i REALLY enjoyed this overall</mark> it was a pleasant surprise to listen this type of stuff i am already familiar with. the vocaloid song that is sampled in <i>waon existence</i> is something that i've playing in <a title="project sekai gaming log" href="/vgs/prsk">project sekai</a> (I THINK) but i cannot for the life of me remember the name of the song</p>

			<p class="info"><b>type:</b> EP</p>
			<p class="info"><b>genres:</b> kpop, pop rock</p>
			<p class="info"><b>date released:</b> 17 august 2023</p>
			<p class="centered"><iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/7hANiZ9XFG3TJPptCPemFW?utm_source=generator" width="70%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe></p>
			<p><mark>LUCY BELOVEDS</mark> <img src="https://doqmeat.neocities.org/!g/pix/emote1lov.gif"> super happy they are back with another EP</p>
			<p>i'd say that i like this EP a tiny bit better than their last one in february. both are very cohessive which is something i feel like kpop releases take for granted, given how they are always trying current trends with their b-sides instead of just making songs that just fit the overall release but ANYWAY i am going into rambling mode let me back up a bit</p>
			<p><b>fever</b> def has a more rock feel to it than <b>insert coin</b> which is a style i prefer more compared to insert coin's more electronic sound.</p>
			<p>but despite this, i think my fav song from this EP would be <i>hot!</i> which is pretty ironic given that this song has a lot of electronic music elements to it... IDK!!! i just love the vibes.</p>
			<p>the title track is also very nice. and as usual with lucy, the <a title="youtube link" href="https://youtu.be/uSW1iY2iacc" target="_blank">music video</a> was an absolute treat to watch! mystic (the company lucy's under) does a really good job with getting nice directors and all that for their MVs. and the storyline for these are very sweet too.</p>
			<p><i>magic</i> is probably the least "energetic" song here but i find it quite nice and fun. and is probably the song that i'll be playing the most from this EP</p>
			<p>nothing mindblowing but this was a nice release from them, overall. thank you lucy!</p>

			<p class="info"><b>type:</b> album</p>
			<p class="info"><b>genres:</b> atmospheric drum n bass, dreampop, post-rock</p>
			<p class="info"><b>date released:</b> 28 july 2023</p>
				
			<p class="centered"><iframe style="border: 0; width: 400px; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1990872915/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=63b2cc/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://turquoisedeath.bandcamp.com/album/se-bueno">Se Bueno by TURQUOISEDEATH</a></iframe></p>
				
			<p>so i was looking around the <a title="a custom chart i made in RYM with DnB and some of it's sub genres. these are the good stuff of those genres of all time." href="https://rateyourmusic.com/charts/top/album,ep/2023/ge:exact,drum-and-bass,dancefloor-drum-and-bass,atmospheric-drum-and-bass,breakbeat/" target="_blank">drum and bass charts</a> of rate your music cus i’ve been meaning to really get into this genre (and some of its sub genres too!) more cus man.... <mark>i do be loving those drums!</mark> <img src="https://doqmeat.neocities.org/!g/pix/catjam.gif"> whenever i hear some breakbeats here and there in a random ass kpop or vocaloid song i get so so so happy. so yeah, so i wanted to check more stuff out and hopefully expand my <a title="spotify" href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6YfGtxhuY1O8VLNyKhjIG5?si=6344645001ae431c" target="_blank">DnB playlist</a> a bit more.</p>

			<p>and from those charts, the first one that got my attention was turquoisedeath’s <b>se bueno</b> !!!</p>

			<p><img src="https://doqmeat.neocities.org/!g/music/other/sebueno.jpg" width="40%" align="left" style="margin-right:10px;">i saw the cover art for this album on the charts and it just made me immediately click on it. not only that, but i also saw that it was a mostly atmospheric dnb and shoegaze (from the RYM genre tags) release which made me super excited to listen to it bc shoegaze is another one of my favorite genres.</p>

			<p>the opening song while just being a simple intro, i kinda fell in love with it. i loved the sounds of someone scribbling away with their pencil. and its mostly just that btw. but it felt very smooth to my brain</p>

			<p>like i had mentioned earlier, <mark>some of these songs have breakbeats while also having that shoegazey sound to them</mark>, something i had never really listened to before. and man was it so cool.</p>

			<p>the prime example of this would be <i>dive</i>, which also features korean artists such as <b>asian glow</b> and <b>parannoul</b>. this was a super pleasant surprise as someone who has listened to both of them and enjoys their stuff! both being mostly shoegaze / noise pop artists. <br> at first i didnt think much of the song. it does start pretty slow afterall. but i didn't really mind the runtime. anyway, it was looking to be a very chill dreampop / shoegazey song and then the breakbeats hit. and i think that opened my eyes to the endless possibilities you have with music. like i've never thought about how it would sound like if you mixed these two genres together, but the result is pretty fucking cool.</p>

			<p><mark>another thing that this album also excels at is in its use of samples</mark>. Which is why, to my understanding, this is considered more of a jungle release than a drum and bass one. i wouldn't call them excessive but theres lots of them and i find them very fun as well. i even managed to catch a sample from <b>pinkpantheress’ break it off</b> in <i>sinking into you</i> which i thought was pretty neat. made me smile a bit.</p>

			<p>another highlight i’d like to talk about is vertigo. this was a super lovely song. and id say its one of the most atmospheric songs in the album. its something i can see myself falling asleep to (i want to say that if i ever say this about a song ever, this is one of the highest compliments i can give it. i love falling asleep to music)</p>

			<p>overall, this was a great album! <img src="https://doqmeat.neocities.org/!g/pix/emote1lov.gif"> i had such a great time listening to it and i might be rating it very highly for a first listen too because of my excitement for it, but i honestly dont give a fuck. this was such an awesome and amazing listen to me. and <mark>i love the different genres in this</mark> as well. the post rock influences, ambient / atmospheric songs with the breakbeats. i genuinely loved it a lot. its so me. i cant wait to listen to it more and more</p>
			<p>will also remind myself to get this on a bandcamp friday at some point</p>

			<p class="centered"><b>this was a relisten!</b></p>
			<p>decided to come back to this EP since it's been a while. and you know what? i just found out that <i>gashina</i> and <i>heroine</i> were included in the initial release of this EP, so i went ahead and listened to it with those songs added and oh boy... i am so happy they DID take out those songs <img src="https://doqmeat.neocities.org/!g/pix/emote1scared.gif"></p>
			<p>because okay i might have my own personal taste but my GOD. besides the fact that i just, simply, dont really like those songs... i just think they sound sooo dated and like. they just dont fit in!! with the rest of <b>warning</b>. so closing thoughts about this: THANK GOD they are not in the current digital version of this album</p>
			<p>AND NOW onto my ACTUAL thoughts of this EP and why i decided to go back to it: i love this album a lot and every song in here is so great (you will everntually read about this when my fav albums page is finished!) <br> i do have to be honest and say that probably another reason why i love this EP so much is because i associate with that time where i was Just stepping in into the world of kpop. but i just genuinely think that this is so great!!! it makes me very nostalgic. especially when i get to <i>secret tape</i></p>
			<p> from the first time i listened to it til this day, i am still so in love with secret tape. i've always loved how sweet and just how heavy it sounds. like its so emotional to me and i love it so so much. i hold that song very close to my heart</p>

			<p>one of those finds where i listen to a <a href="https://youtu.be/XZd82renpc4" target="_blank">mv teaser</a> of a group i had never heard of before and decide that i will tune in based off the instrumental. because honestly, when i listened to that teaser it felt a like smelling fresh air or however that saying goes. i hear some synths and i am in! it just sounded very refreshing to me</p>
			<p>i was only just looking forward to the title track (turn it off) but the entire EP kinda surprised me upon listening to it!</p>
			<p>but yeah, <i>turn it off</i> was pretty damn good and it delivered for me. i also recently found out it was produced by a team member of sweetune. its always them and their crazy ass synthpop songs, which i need to listen more off tbh... but moving on. <br><i>like crazy</i> was a pleasant surprise in this EP, i LOVEEE songs like these. very upbeat, makes me wanna do jumps everytime i listen to it. reminds me a lot of tempest's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtHVW80-PPk" target="_blank">start up</a>. its the same vibes. <br>and i also got a drum and bass song in here with <i>hurt</i> ???? i lowkey won. and i say lowkey bc its a very okay song but i see the vision okay?</p>
			<p>overall i dont think this release is anything mindblowing tbh but i def appreciate the effort that went into making this! there are some solid jams in here and for that i give it 1 thumbs up <img src="https://doqmeat.neocities.org/!g/pix/emote2thumbup.gif"></p>

		<p>i dont listen to a lot of covers of my favorite songs, but a while ago i stumbled upon this video. a cover of siinamota's <a title="original PV on youtube" href="https://youtu.be/AqI97zHMoQw" target="_blank">young girl a</a>, and man. i really just love how heavy (not literally but) their voices sounds. like i've stumbled upon a lot of cover of young girl a before, but this one just... gets it. i get it. i really like their voices.</p>
