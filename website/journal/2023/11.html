			<p>long time no..... see? at least in my journal page! this will be a bit disorganized but i just wanna write a bit about what i've been up to as of late!</p>
			<hr>
			<p>i'm currently working on version 3 of my homepage! been learning A LOT about grids and even started to get the hang of it, which is what i'm using to make the homepage v3 layout :3 i'm super excited to get it done! but i'm taking my time with this one. so expect it sometime around the first half of december!</p>
			<hr>
			<p>i've been making an effort as of late to be more active and spend less time on my computer just sitting around...</p>
			<p>i've talked about walking + <a title="wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pikmin_Bloom" target="_blank" class="outlink">pikmin bloom</a> previously here. but i stopped going on walks because i got sick with covid around august. and my god did i have a serious cough after 2 months of recovering from covid. <img src="/!g/pix/catsob1.gif"> so yeah. for a bit i really just lost my motivation for walking.</p>

			<p>but! since i've been eating better lately so i thought "hey.... i should REALLY put in the effort into walking daily again..." so i have! the past few days i've been going on walks around my neighborhood that last for about an hour. i try to push myself a bit everyday. nothing i can't handle of course. but i've been enjoying it so far!</p>

			<p class="f-fix"><img src="!g/231127-pikmin-bloom1.jpg" width="50%" align="left" style="margin: 10px;"> and i've also picked up pikmin bloom again :) walking around the same places everyday can get quite... monotonous. but i really like that pikmin bloom helps me out with the walks not feeling as boring as they seem to be. i also use the app as a journal of sorts. i take pics of whatever i find interesting (enough) to take a pic of. i think it's super cute.</p>

			<hr>

			<p>STILL Crazy Obsessed with <a title="gaming log" href="/vgs/fashion-dreamer/index.html" target="_parent">fashion dreamer</a>. i'm still playing it daily. and once i get sick of it, i'm planning on downloading a DS (and 3DS if there's any idk) emulator so i can play the <i>style savvy</i> games. i've heard A LOT of valid criticism towards <i>fashion dreamer</i> so i've very curious as to how the older games were. as someone who has never played them!</p>

			<hr>

			<p>my plan of <a title="journal log" href="#8">ditching spotify premium</a> and figuring out other ways of listening to music has actually been somewhat successful. i say somewhat because i still use spotify quite a lot. at least on desktop since i recently learned that you will not get any ads if you open it on your desktop browser with an ad-blocker LMAO..... that's what you get for being annoying.</p>

			<p>in other music news: my <a href="/music/cds.html">CD collection</a> should be getting an update in the coming weeks!</p>

			<p>i managed to find a copy of yeule's <b>serotonin II</b> on ebay! since i was the only one who bid on it (LOL) i got it for just $5 <img src="/!g/pix/emote1happy2.gif"> it was sealed and everything so i'm super happy i found that album at that price. it recently arrive too and the photos in the booklet are sooooo cool. i love yeule's work a lot. can't wait to be able to scan it.</p>

				<p><small>serotonin II jewel case alongside a stupid (lovingly) baby cat patch i bought for some <a title="will open a pic of said overalls in a new tab! ignore the finger emoji *sob* i'm planning on putting the cat patch on the center of the front pocket." href="!g/231127-gay-overalls.jpg" target="_blank">overalls</a> i have!</small></p>
			</center>

			<p>i have another album on the way as well, which i've talked about on a previous journal log <a href="#8">here</a>! owning my favorite albums physically is so cool. to be able to hold them and look at the artwork while listening to it. i love CDs. and i love owning the music that i love!!!!</p>

			<hr>

			<p>anyway, i will now watch satoshi kon's <i>tokyo godfathers</i> while eating some ice cream. hope anyone reading this has a nice day!</p>

			<p>it might take a bit while i start working on my plushies / figurines page <small>(currently working on v3 of my homepage!)</small> but ANYWAY!</p>
			<p>i wanted to share this <mark>power and meowy</mark> figurine i bought like 2 weeks ago when i went to the mall to watch <i>killers of the flower moon</i> <small>(good movie btw, hate leonardo dicaprio's ass but lily gladstone did an amazing job in her role!)</small></p>
			<p>while waiting for the our movie to start i walked around the mall for a bit and visited some stores. in one of them i stumbled upon the most PRECIOUS figurine i've ever witnessed in my life! <img src="/!g/pix/emote1lov2.gif"></p>
			<p class="centered"><img src="!g/231110-powy.jpeg" width="48%" alt="picture of an anime figurine. power is holding her cat, meowy!"> <img src="!g/231110-meowy.jpeg" width="48%" alt="picture of an anime figurine. same figurine as the previous one but this picture is from another angle. you can see the cat's face."></p>
			<p>LOOK AT THEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! they are so adorable <img src="/!g/pix/heart3.gif"> my fucking meow meows.... i love power and meowy a lot so AS MUCH AS I TRY to save the little money i have, i really but really needed this and boy... everytime i look at them i can't help but smile! <img src="/!g/pix/emote1happy2.gif"></p>

			<h1 class="entry"><span class="title">ways of consuming music</span> <span class="date">08.nov.23</span></h1>
			<p>today i woke up at 7:45am to be able to get my hands on a limited edition CD of <a href="https://kinoue64.bandcamp.com/album/--33" target="_blank" class="outlink">空​間​、​事​情​、​時​間​、​事​象​</a>, one of my beloved vocaloid albums!</p>
			<p>i almost fell asleep while waiting for it to be 8am o'clock so i could refresh the page. i hit refresh. 7 copies remaining. i click on the limited edition CD, 1 copy remaining. half asleep, i managed to grab the very last copy <img src="https://doqmeat.neocities.org/!g/deco/catlaying.gif"></p>
			<p>lately i've been using my CDs as my main way of listening to music while on my car. i think i need to buy a new AUX cable... but anyway, i really can't wait for it to arrive! i love owning the music that i love.</p>
			<p>on a similar note: i cancelled my spotify premium subscription! after seeing their shitty changes in how they pay will artists over the years (most notably the recent change of <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/spotify-plots-change-to-royalties-structure-with-a-minimum-streams-per-song-requirement-for-payout/" target="_blank" class="outlink">minimum streams per song</a>) + i decided to see if i can handle being off spotify premium. i think it might be a bit difficult given i use spotify SO MUCH, especially for finding new things to listen to. it made the process of listening to new music much easier, but i think i can put those extra 12 monthly dollars to better use.</p>
			<p>so far here is my plan:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>use bandcamp for streaming and such! i have quite a couple of collections there alongside many albums wishlisted there that i have yet to listen!</li>
				<li>transfer my CDs to my computer. that way i can download it in a micro SD card and listen to it on my phone as well (for those that aren't available in bandcamp)</li>
				<li>use CDs for driving</li>
				<li>with those extra $12 i'll be saving from spotify, i can use them to save up and buy more of my favorite albums!</li>
