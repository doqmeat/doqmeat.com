			<h1 class="entry"><span class="title">free from uni</span><span class="date">20.may.24</span></h1>
			<p>ilast friday i finished the very last essay i had to turn in this past semester and now i am <b>100% FREE</b> !!!!</p>
			<p>right when i sent my essay, i opened my code editor and starting working on my <a href="/collection/plushies/index.html" target="_parent">plushies</a> page! it's currently finished though i would love to add some more decorations to it! it was a very fun page to do and i love how colorful it turned out.</p>
			<p>the past few days i've been cleaning my place like CRAZY since i have so much more time now. i find it a bit crazy how nowadays i actually <b>like</b> waking up in the morning! though i am pretty sure that part of that is because i love cooking myself breakfast... sometimes i be excited to wake up and start my day bc that means i get to eat my favorite meal of the day. breakfast. i think this is what life is truly about. it's also nice because it feels like i have more productive days + i can do more during the day.</p>
			<p>when taking breaks from cleaning i'm either playing <a href="/vgs/fallout-1/index.html" target="_parent">fallout</a> or working on my <a href="https://siinamota.doqmeat.com" target="_blank" class="outlink">siinamota fansite</a>. i am a big fan of siinamota's work <small>(for those who don't know: he is a vocaloid producer!)</small> and i've been meaning to make a fansite for the past year or so! i like compiling info about his music, interviews, art, etc. + i needed a place to showcased my scanned albums so other people who enjoy his work can also check them out. ++ the lack of a dedicated wiki for him also inspired me to make this fansite!</p>
			<img src="!g/240520-fansite.jpg" width="100%"><br>
			<center><small>screenshot of index as of 20.may.24</small></center>
			<p>building it has been a quite challenging experience <small>believe it or not</small> since i want to implement some of the javascript stuff i've learned over the past couple of months. which ain't a lot but it is something! i managed to make a little window for the album scans page that you can toggle on n off but the hardest part was making each window disappear when pressing another album. i spent HOURSSS trying to figure it out. turns out i had to use a little special code that looks like this:</p>
			<textarea style="display:block;max-width: 400px;width:100%;margin:10px;">i = 0; i &lt; example.length; i++</textarea>
			<p>i am quite honestly still trying to wrap my head around what this is... but at some point i will get it. just not today. nonetheless i think i've done a lot of progress when it comes to javascript! i am Kind Of getting it tbh. and i want to put that to use for this fansite!</p>
			<p>i also wanna set up a fanlisting as well at some point but that will have to wait a good while for now. i wanna have the site pretty completed when i get around to doing that! i have a ton of cool ideas for it but i need to take it slow so i don't burn out + so i can enjoy doing other things during my summer break!</p>
			<p>hope you are all taking care!</p>

			<h1 class="entry"><span class="title">end of 1st uni semester</span><span class="date">04.may.24</span></h1>
			<p>my first uni semester is coming to an end this coming week! it is crazy how fast everything went. not sure if it's because i am doing something with my time or if... time is just like that now. i have learned a lot throughout this semester about myself and other things. there's a lot of stuff i need to work on! despite pushing myself to be less shy in classes, i really want to talk more in the future. i'll get there one day hopefully.</p>
			<p>so far, i really enjoy going to uni. i'm still pretty introverted but i managed to make 2 friends this semester ^_^ we sometimes go and study at an ice cream place near the train, and i went to the mall with my other friend and we also got some ice cream there. the 2 people i've befriended love ice cream. it's very nice. i often tell myself that i like being alone. part of that is true. i love being by myself. it feels very refreshing and peaceful. but the immense happiness these new friendships have given me reminded me that i also like meeting new people and connecting with them. a reminder that i am still a social being to my core.</p>
			<p>even if i'm not very social, i still find the atmosphere of the university very nice. i also enjoy taking the train almost on a daily basis. not having to drive and waste money on a weekly basis on gas has also given me immense joy in my life. i am being very serious. i lowkey hate driving. and not only that, but i find the train rides itself very relaxing. i've been walking way more because of this. which is great because i don't really have the energy to do some Actual exercise nowadays <small>though i am pretty sure i could if i scheduled my time for it</small>.</p>
			<p>all in all, i had a very nice time here. on august i will be taking my first computer science. i'm super curious to take that class and see what they'll be teaching there. so i'm really looking forward to it! i am a little bit nervous <img src="/!g/pix/catsweat.gif" alt="sweating emoji"> but i know i'll be okay at the end of the day.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>with this semester coming to an end i will be free once again to do more stuff in here! i have some <b>blog</b> posts that i've been meaning to publish for a while. though i would also love to keep working on building my siinamota fansite! i have so many fun ideas but we'll see! i also wanna continue playing <a href="/vgs/fallout-1/index.html" target="parent">fallout 1</a> and eventually start a new game in <a href="/vgs/fallout-new-vegas/index.html" target="_parent">new vegas</a>.</p>
			<p>and that's not even all! i'll be visiting my beloved cat <a href="/shrines/mizu/index.html" target="_parent">mizu</a> this summer as well! it's been such a long time since i've seen him... i really can't wait to pet him and give him forehead kisses. i'll be so happy to see him.</p>
