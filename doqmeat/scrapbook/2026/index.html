          watched another hirokazu koreeda movie and my god this was just so beautiful. why is every film i've watched from this director so fucking painful??? i really loved <b>monster</b> but this story comes pretty close and the way it <span class="spoilers">all unravels at the end...</span>. i can't wait to fucking DIE when the live action movie of look back releases.

          <p> i feel like i should have NOT enjoyed this movie as much as i did. i only watched it because of clips i've seen from it while looking up <i>heads will roll</i> remixes by the <b>yeah yeah yeahs</b>. like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzcCpHLA_8g" target="_blank">this video</a>. i did not expect it to be this funny though AND i did not expect MY MANNNNNN thomas mann to be one of the protagonists either. i miss seeing him in stuff... making me want to rewatch <b>me and earl and the dying girl</b> but i need to be strong.</p>
