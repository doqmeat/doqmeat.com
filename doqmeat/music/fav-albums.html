					<h2>sepia record - siinamota</h2>

					<p><img title="artwork by meisa" src="!g/fav-albums/sepiarecord.jpg" width="40%" class="r-img">the first siinamota / powapowap album i listened to and how i discovered him!</p>


					<p>man this album.... this is something i have very VERY close to my heart. it is a very important piece of media to me.</p>


					<p>the songs while pretty simple (at times) have such a heavy weight to them. this is a beautiful album to me, but it also hurts to listen to because there's such a melancholic feeling to it. it feels very lonely too. i dont know maybe i am just rambling at this point.</p>

					<p>and dont even get me started on the <b>zinnia and meme</b> storyline that siinamota introduces in this album... amazing</p>


					<p>ever since i listened to this i have not been the same. this album was a turning point for myself and the reason why i love siinamota so so so much today</p>


					<p>i dont think i'll ever own this physically since early siinamota albums are a pain to find (+ super expensive) but if i could have any of the albums on my wishlist it would be this one. <b>sepia record</b> i love YOU!</p>


					<p><img src="!g/fav-albums/sepiarecord-remodel.jpg" width="40%" align="left" style="margin-right:10px;">and i think its also worth mentioning that i love the remaster (known as the <b>remodel</b>) version of this album as well. while i think the original ver is perfect, the remodel version touches up on some things and i really appreciate the small details added to the songs.</p>


					<p>for example in <i>sky fish</i>, siinamota added strings in the final verse of the song which makes it my fav version of it.</p>

					<h2>soul lady - yukika</h2>
					<p><img src="!g/cds/yukika-soullady.jpg" width="40%" class="r-img">soul lady my beloved <img src="/!g/deco/hellokitty.gif" width="40px"></p>
					<p>if i had to pin point an album that made me go insane about kpop, it would be this one</p>
					<p>this was also the first ever album (i keep saying this but in reality this is the 2nd ever album i bought, the first one being loona's 12:00....... but i like to think i bought this one first) that i have ever bought with my hard earned retail money *shivers*</p>
					<p><img src="!g/cds/yukika-soullady-poster.jpg" width="40%" align="left" style="margin-right:10px;">this album kinda changed me honestly. i still really think this if one of the best, if not THE BEST, kpop albums of all time. from start to finish. from top to bottom. i have never enjoyed an album as much as this one</p>
					<p>i will always hold this album very close to my heart</p>

					<p>i feel like before listening to this album i wasnt so crazy abt music to the point where i would sit down every day to listen to something new, write down my fav songs of whatever i had just listened. i was just an average music enjoyer. but one day i just listened to this and it really just like opened my eyes to how fucking good an album could be.</p>
					<p>so thank you yukika</p>
					<p><img src="!g/cds/yukika-soullady-tracks.jpg" width="100%"></p>
					<p>not that anyone gaf but fun fact: i think this is the rarest album i have. thank god i bought back in 2020 when there were still some on stock so i had to only spend $20 on it. awesome!!!! i love capitalism!!! no but really i think im lucky to own this before it sold out. i love the physical ver of this album a lot.</p>
					<p><img title="i love this pic so much wtf are these bunny men lamps" src="!g/cds/yukika-soullady-bunnylamp.jpg" width="100%"></p>
					<p>since the title track is about yukika becoming a seoul (soul) lady, the album inclutions have a theme of traveling and it even came with a yukika passport in which the first page has her info</p>
					<p><img src="!g/cds/yukika-soullady-passport.jpg" width="50%"><a title="open img in a new tab" href="!g/cds/yukika-soullady-passport-in.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="!g/cds/yukika-soullady-passport-in.jpg" width="50%"></a></p>

					<p>and the rest of the passport's pages are the song's lyrics and every song has their own unique visa stamp which i find so cute and creative tbh. i love this fake passport</p>
					<p><img src="!g/cds/yukika-soullady-pitapet.jpg" width="100%"></p>
					<p>i've also made a carrd inspired by the passport! i remember i had so much fun trying to recreate it. sadly i have a new template for my carrd and i didnt save this one but you can still check out through the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230424014841/https://desteny.carrd.co/#a" target="_blank">wayback machine</a> (though the imgs that show up werent the ones i was using). i hope to recreate it on my website someday! maybe for a yukika shrine? hmmmmmm <img src="/!g/pix/cathead.gif"></p>

					<p><img src="!g/fav-albums/148.jpg" width="40%" class="r-img">i have always kept up with c418 after being such a fan of the minecraft ost. i think this album of his dropped while i was still in middle school or something like that and MAN.... did it fucking HIT.</p>
					<p>obv this is pretty different from what i've heard of him in minecraft, but that did not stop me from loving this around that time. and i still do.</p>
					<p>pretty fucking awesome progressive house listen with some drum & bass tunes as well! of course i love this.</p>
					<p>at the time i listened to this for the first time, the only thing i knew was that i really liked electronic music and my taste wasnt as defined as it is today but wow. relistening this album now and it is just so perfect to my taste.</p>
					<p>i used to have <i>habitual crush</i> and <i>friend</i> on repeat in middle school while i was going through something a bit gay. you know how it is.</p>

					<h2>生きる (ikiru) - siinamota</h2>
					<p><img src="/shrines/siinamota/ikiru/cover-front.jpg" width="50%" class="r-img">the first siinamota album i bought physically (THANK YOU CDJAPAN!)</p>
					<p>i think this album was like my 2nd ever siinamota album i had listened to. when i used to be A LOT on t*ktok, i used to hear <i>young girl a</i> A LOT on it. like it was everywhere. and as embarrasing as it is... that was kinda how i found out about siinamota.</p>
					<p>so, after listening to <b>sepia record</b> i went ahead and listened to this</p>
					<p>and boy. what a contrast</p>
					<p>this album is way more energetic than sepia record, i would even say it has a wider range of emotions. it has chaotic songs, songs that make me (personally) go up and down, slay af rock songs, and it even includes a nice down tempo song with a throwback to <i>strobe light</i> from <b>award strobe hello</b></p>
					<p>and despite everything that i just said, it still manages to be cohesive</p>
					<p>in this album siinamota put <a title="label webpage" href="https://www.umaa.net/what/ikiru.html" target="_blank">themes</a> to every song related to life. from "birth" all the way to "future" and "life". its very interesting how every song has a specific theme attached to it. i dont have much else to say about this atm but i just find it very cool.</p>
					<p><img src="/shrines/siinamota/ikiru/cd.jpg" width="50%" align="left" style="margin-right:10px;rotate:20deg;">as i have mentioned at the beggining of this page, i own this album!!! i love looking at the booklet every once in a while since it features artwork from siinamota himself. i like his art style. i have uploaded my scans to <a href="https://archive.org/details/ikiru-scans" target="_blank">archive.org</a> if anyone wants to take a look. here are my fav pages from the booklet nonetheless</p>
					<p><a title="open in a new tab" href="/shrines/siinamota/ikiru/page-3.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="/shrines/siinamota/ikiru/page-3.jpg" width="100%"></a></p>

					<p>also what a pain is it to live in puerto rico when it comes to international shipping. i be setting up dates with the fedex driver every time i bought from CDJAPAN. but man was it so worth it for a siinamota album</p>

					<h2>villain : the end - drippin</h2>
					<p><img src="!g/cds/drippin-theend.jpg" width="40%" class="r-img">OOOH BOY!!!!!!!! its drippin time</p>
					<p>this fucking album. the night this album dropped i was so hyper id even say. insufferable even. it was CRAZYYYY</p>
					<p>i honestly didnt expect much prior to this album's release and having listened to their <a href="https://youtu.be/Nae2jTwxRp4" target="_blank">highlight medley</a> i didnt think much of it.</p>
					<p>BUT i did know that i was going to LOVE <i>the one</i> since it was going to have that drum & bass that i love in the chorus. i was so excited for that song specifically</p>
					<p>so its release day. and as im listening through the album everything sounds very very good. until i got to <i>utopia</i>. my god. i must be the most annoying person about this song.</p>
					<p>it was 5am when i heard this song and i wanted to jump and just do SOMETHING with my body so badly from the excitement that entered my body from hearing <i>utopia</i>. so im guessing whomever is reading this must be going "wtf is he talking about...." and i cant blame you. but lets have a little story time</p>
					<p>the reason why i went fucking crazy with this song is because it sampled sounds from their DEBUT song: <i>nostalgia</i>. i found this group because of their debut stage and nostalgia is also one of my favorite songs of theirs. so hearing it get sampled in <i>utopia</i> was fucking CRAZYYYYY to me. i love these 2 songs very dearly.</p>

					<p>and as far as kpop albums go, this was indeed very enjoyable :) i was smiling like crazy listening to this from start to finish. which is something...... so rare when i am listening to kpop albums.</p>

					<p>i also own this album physically. cus again i love it a lot (and this is one of my fav kpop groups at the moment). heres a scan of a page! left is alex and on the right is dongyun. i really like alex' pic</p>

					<p><img title="arwork by momoc" src="!g/fav-albums/kokeganenouta.jpg" align="right" width="40%" style="margin-left:10px">LOVE. love love love <img src="/!g/pix/catheart.gif"></p>
					<p>okay... okay okay. i think this might be my 2nd fav siinamota release (not album since its an EP) because just wow. there's so many neat things here that i just love so so much</p>
					<p>first of all: <b>the breakbeats</b> in the instrumentals. amazing. i honestly love how siinamota used breakbeats / drumloops. and i wish there were more of it in his discography! but maybe that's what makes them so special to me...</p>
					<p>which is why <i>mashiro no iro</i> is one of my favorites from his entire discography. i love the overall melancholic feel of the song mixed with these crazy breakbeats. like how do you even manage to make breakbeats sound SAD? (im sure theres a very simple explination for this) and it reminds of <mark>sulli's</mark> <a title="youtube audio" href="https://youtu.be/kzUZABVj5UQ" target="_blank">dorothy</a>. i think i just have a thing for sad drum & bass songs. cus i really do find them so so cool. cus you dont really associate that type of song with those type of feelings.... IDK i just think music is so cool tbh.</p>
					<p>this one doesnt have that melancholic feel to it but another song that features breakbeats in this EP is <i>うたをうたうひと (uta wo utau hito)</i></p>
					<p>second of all: <i>year 3 class c-14, chiyoko kubozono's joining of the cabinet</i>. what a great opening track. i love this song so so much. i love the whole 8-bit whatever sound that the intro has and the chorus is so so catchy AND THE PV is so cute (and a bit dark) too</p>

					<p>third of all: yeah i have my favorites but all of the songs are simply just so so so lovely. <i>in my head</i> opens with a very nice guitar and miku's tuning also feels so gentle <img src="/!g/pix/catupndown.gif"></p>
					<p>and i havent even started talking about the <b>art</b> of this album!!!!! the artwork featured in the album cover and booklet is by japanese artist <a title="pixiv profile" href="https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/849346" target="_blank">momoc</a>!</p>

					<p>and let me tell you: this might be my favorite album cover. its so colorful and pretty. and i think it encapsulates well the vibes of this EP. thanks to this album cover, i got to know more about momoc's other work as well, and i just love their art style so much!!! i'll make a page someday on my site showcasing my fav works from them.</p>
					<p>here are some pages from the <a title="archive.org page" href="https://archive.org/details/kokegane-no-uta-scans" target="_blank">booklet</a> (scans provided to me! i hope to own the CD someday) with more illustrations by momoc</p>

					<p>well. they got my ass <img src="/!g/pix/catsob.gif"> say whatever you want abt this album but this shit went HARD as hell when i was in middle school AND!!!! i do think that it still goes hard. except for a song or two BUT i swear i've had each of these songs on repeat at some point of my life. very crucial album to who i am today (i will say this about every album on this page)</p>
					<p>probably one of the first albums i fully listened to.... if im being honest</p>

					<h2>呼吸 (Kokyuu) - lily chou-chou</h2>
					<p><img src="!g/fav-albums/Kokyuu.jpg" width="40%" class="r-img">the way this album found it's way to me its not very crazy tbh but i still find it like. a very interesting experience</p>
					<p>i was listening to my soft and melancholic playlist on spotify and i think it had already played all the songs in it and went into radio mode (plays songs similar to the ones on the playlist) so i accidentally fell asleep with the playlist on and when i woke im it was playing a song from this album (i cant remember which one <img src="/!g/pix/catfall.gif">) and i just went like "woahhhhh what the fuck am i listening to and why is it so good???"</p>
					<p>i did some research (half asleep) and i got so sad when i saw that this was the only album in the artist's discography on spotify. so i did more digging til i found out that lily chou-chou isnt even a real person!!! this album was the soundtrack of a movie called <mark>all about lily chou-chou</mark>. and i just found the whole concept so interesting that i watched the movie on the next day</p>
					<p>and just WOW. what a fucking experience. i watched the movie first before listening to the full album and im glad i did tbh. because its just so good and it fits so nicely into the movie. like yeah this is still an AMAZING album on its own. but i think the film just makes it even more special, you know? absolutely so gorgeous</p>
					<p>highly recommend this to the dreampop enjoyers out there</p>

						kinoue64! they are one of my top 3 vocaloid producer!!!! mostly because of their shoegaze / dreampop sound and just how WELL it mixes with miku's voice and tuning. i find it to be such a perfect combination. this whole EP while being only 4 tracks, it is just so so good.</p>
					<p>but most of the reason for why this release of theirs is here is because of the title track <i>ghost</i>. this songs..... i fucking feel this song to my chest. there is just something so raw about it. i know it is something about the intro that always gets to me... not sure what. but i love that it can make me feel that way</p>

					<p>this album (and most of what beach house makes) is the equivalent of a dream. i am dreaming and i am sleeping on the clouds. each song song in this is sooooo soothing. i love putting this album on just for me to fall asleep to it.</p>
					<p>there's a ton of great songs in here. but the song that absolutely took my breath away the first time i listen to it was <i>PPP</i> and <mark>to this day</mark> it still takes me away every fucking time i listen to it. <br> i was actually thinking recently about what would be my favorite song ever if someone asked me. well, that song would be PPP indeed. it is so delicate and soft. it's like if someone was holding me gently as we dance. and don't even get me started on that HEAVENLY outro with the guitars and synths and victoria's (lead singer of beach house!) lovely voice. quite honestly making me want to sob everyime i listen to it. i love it so much.</p>
					<p>the booklet of this album doesn't include lyrics so i made a custom one which you can view <a href="/art/post/depression-cherry-booklet" target="_blank">here!</a></p>

					<h2>goblin - sulli</h2>
					<p><img src="!g/fav-albums/goblin.jpg" alt="goblin album cover" width="40%" class="r-img">
						NOW... this will probably be the only single that appears on this page. but let me just say that this release is something so so special to me. it just Sounds like there was so much thought and love behind this from the lovely sulli.</p>
					<p>every song in this is very sweet and i love them all a lot!!! but the one that rips me appart every time i listen to it is <i>dorothy</i>. i think i talked about this in <b>kokegane no uta</b>'s entry, but i love love LOVE the use of drum and bass for melancholic songs like these. dorothy is just so.... it feels so heavy and her voice feels so tired. i find it very soothing, while a bit haunting at the same time. while the drum and bass contrasts the piano that the song features throughout its instrumental, it also remains cohesive because of the repetiveness nature of the lyrics. it isn't something that was put in there just to have a new sound to these type of songs. </p>
					<p>i think genuine thought was put into this. like there is genuine passion behind this release!! which i feel like it's something that (of course, lol) lacks so much when it comes to kpop. this feels like it came from someone's heart. rest in peace sulli <img src="/!g/pix/heart4.png"></p>
					<p>this single never got a physical release for some reason. so a mini project i want to make for myself is to make a custom made CD jewel case for <b>goblin</b>! and also burn the songs on a CD of course. i think it will be a very fun experience.</p>

						i bought the CD for this album around early 2021 and boy has it gotten me through some of my darkest times. </p>
					<p>this is a bit of a TMI but for the sake of context: let's just say i used to live in a place where i would have to turn in my phone and everything else electronic before going to sleep. quite honestly hell. anyway, the only sort of relief i had from those horrible moments were my boombox and my CDs. and i used to play this one a lot. it would calm me down with its somber, and yet catchy songs.</p>
					<p>i've been a hude fan of oohyo since then! i adore her music</p>
