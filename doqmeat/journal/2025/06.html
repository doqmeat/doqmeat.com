      <p>during my last madoka magica rewatch on december 2023 i was thinking about how ass it is that i have have to watch this through some shady ass anime site where the eng subtitles barely work so i had to watch the eng dub instead. like damn that sucks! and i'm not paying for a crunchyroll subscription either! so i decided to eventually start looking for physical versions of the <b>anime</b> and <b>rebellion</b> once i had a bit of money to spend.</p>
      <p>while looking though ebay i noticed that some region A blu-rays of madoka were AWFULLY a bit expensive. especially the box sets. i initially thought that physical versions of PMMM were simply out of stock though their official stores. <small>and this is not the case btw, you can get some sets over at the <a href="https://store.crunchyroll.com/collections/puella-magi-madoka-magica/" target="_blank" class="outlink">crunchyroll</a> store... at Normal prices.</small></p>
      <p><img src="!g/0601-madoka-anime-box.jpg" width="25%" style="float:left;margin:10px;" alt="PMMM anime bluray box">one day i stumbled upon a listing of a madoka blu-ray labeled <q>PMMM Disc I & II</q>. the listing mention it was from a box set but my foolish ass didn't bother to look more into it. you see, i was thinking that disc I & II had PMMM beginnings and eternal respectively. or at least 6 episodes on each disc. but then the blu-ray arrived and um. it was not what i was thinking!</p>

      </figure>
      <p>each disc has 4 episodes. meaning that i was missing the last final 4 episodes of the anime. <img src="/!g/pix/catangry.gif" alt="angry emoji"> honestly for the price of $40 i decided to keep it bc i don't think the anime (not the movie versions of the anime) is getting any more blu-rays anytime soon. there are minor differences between the movies and the anime, bit at least i have the iconic scene of hitomi going <q>girls can't love girls!!!</q> (happy pride month btw <img src="/!g/pix/gaycat.gif" alt="cat with a rainbow emoji">) with this purchase since that scene is missing in the movie version of the anime. i did some more digging and i found the disc i was missing. unfortunately the only listing of it (separately) i'm seeing on ebay is at $108 and there is no way i'm touching that at that price. i'm gonna keep being in the look out for it nonetheless and if i get another madoka disc, i'll write another log about it.</p>

      <p><img title="here's what the box looks like without the disc case" src="!g/0601-front-empty.jpg" alt="bluray box without the discs box" width="30%" style="float:right;margin:10px;">i eventually got the limited edition <b>rebellion</b> blu-ray for a pretty nice price and MAN is that how you do packaging. this has to be one of the most gorgeous and detailed packages that i've ever seen. i love the whole theater / play motif that is used in the series as well. whoever designed this did such a great job. it includes 3 dics: the movie, an extra disc with bonus features, and the OST. the OST was a very pleasant surprise to have here. i listened to it on my portable CD player while hanging clothes and man... what a beautiful score. it's so delicate. my favorite song from there is possibly <a href="https://youtu.be/xs1IZQywogo?si=2PqXGXJ5kXqOms6Z" target="_blank" class="outlink">this is my despair</a>.</p>

      <p><img src="!g/0601-material-book.jpg" alt="material book front cover" width="40%" style="float:left;margin:10px;">it also included a material book with an interview from members of the crew, inu curry artworks, storyboards, other art and posters! i loved seeing these very much, specially the inu curry artworks. to my luck everything has been translated to eng by the <a href="https://wiki.puella-magi.net/Rebellion_Material_Book" target="_blank" class="outlink">puella magi wiki</a>. thank god i dont have to photo translate this because it is lowkey incomprehensible when i tried to do it.</p>
      <!-- pictures of the material book -->
      <p>on my 6th watching of rebellion i am still noticing new things about the film. watching this on my tv via my PS5 who works part time as a blu-ray player feels SO awesome. i like owning blu-rays of my favorite movies (should do a list of the ones i own someday on my site!) so these dics were a much necessary addition to my collection since i'm always on shady places to be able to watch them. <mark>i love physical media</mark>.</p>
