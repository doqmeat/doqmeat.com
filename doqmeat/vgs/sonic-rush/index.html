		<h3>logs</h3>
		<p><span class="date">09.jun.24</span> i have been playing this game on and off since i was like 9 years old... this game at this point has been ingrained in my brain as an iconic moment of my childhood. i love playing this game and it's <b>insane</b> <a title="youtube full OST" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvNp0Boas721Cm9CWT9eaSq_JxA3f_NAr&si=2T4DhnaBrKZFcrxL" target="_blank">soundtrack</a> when i was little. it was also my introduction to the <i>sonic series</i> and probably why i love blaze the cat <small>meow meow</small> so much to this day <small>despite barely engaging in any sonic games throughtout my gamer life. </small></p>
		<p>the thing is that i would frequently get stuck in levels or bosses (and i still do...) so that is the main reason as to why to this day. me at 14 years old. has not finished this game....</p>
		<p>BUT! i was able to pick up my <a title="journal log" href="/journal/2024/06.html#4" target="_parent">3DS</a> again and since <i>sonic rush</i> is literally the only DS/3DS cardtridge i own, i decided to boot it up again. man. YES. i am deeply nostalgic for this game, but i also love the look and feel of it despite me having such a hard time with it sometimes. it is so much fun after i've died a couple of times and finally get the hang out of the level. I SWEAR!!</p>
		<p>anyways, i picked it up recently from where i left off, zone 7. been playing it for the past week and i am currently at the final boss of the game! in both sonic's and blaze's ... timeline? save? <small>idk whats the correct term...</small> but sadly i have been having A LOT of trouble with this boss(es) <small>they are the same thing</small> and i am getting a bit burnt out!!! i really want to finish this game but oh my god. i am not having fun with this one... i'm gonna see if turning on easy mode can maybe alleviate this boss fight...</p>
		<p>i might talk a bit more about more about the soundtrack in a future listening log and link it here when i do because this is seriously one of my favorite video game soundtracks. thank you hideki naganuma, CEO of funky fresh beats.</p>
