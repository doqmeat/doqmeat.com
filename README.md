# doqmeat.com
hello! this is the repository of my personal website, [doqmeat.com](https://doqmeat.com/)

## about site
- i upload my code using deploy to neocities and git following miss moss's [deploy2nekoweb](https://deploy.nekoweb.org/)
- tested on firefox, on a desktop. and on chrome and mobile sometimes
- hosted on [nekoweb](https://nekoweb), previosly hosted on [neocities](https://neocities)
- this massive site is all hand-coded HTML #freak

## source code
- i learned how to code HTML and CSS by looking at other people's code and <b>playing around with it offline</b>, you're welcome to do that with mine! i also learned by going to sites like w3schools, using HTML templates, and the likes.
- you're free to take any code you need from my site for your own <3 though do be aware that i've used code that isn't mine and is credited on my site. refrain from taking this code without crediting the creators.
- with that said, i prefer if you <b>did not copy the entire code of a page and upload it to your site as a base</b>. the only code you can do that with is my [F2U HTML templates](https://doqmeat.com/notebook/F2U/templates.html). if you do end up doing this i'll be a bit sad but after a week i'll be fine 👍
