				<h2 class="title"><b>3rd desire [reve]</b> - kim woo seok</h2>
				<img src="!g/reve.png" width="40%" align="left" alt="album cover">
				<p class="info"><b>type:</b> EP</p>
				<p class="info"><b>genres:</b> kpop, dancepop</p>
				<p class="info"><b>date released:</b> 7 march 2022</p>
				<p>i've been obsessed with <i>satisfied</i> for at least the past 2 months or so. i don't think the song itself is that crazy but it definitely has an insane intoxicating vibe to it. and i am once again asking... why do kpop producers always get most interesting instrumentals for intros and outros ?!?!?! it feels like they do it on purpose because they hate me! it's ridiculous!!</p>
				<p>BUT ANYWAY. because of that song, i decided to check out this EP. by ex-X1 member (<a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/arts-culture/music/k-pop-group-x1-disband-after-television-voting-scandal-1.961191" target="_blank" class="outlink">rip</a>): kim woo seok. i have a bit of a funny story with that group. they seem to follow me like a ghost tbh.</p>
				<p>on first listen, this EP was pretty much...... whatever. i didn't think much of the songs. but recently i listened to it again and i think it clicked. it honestly feels very cohesive except for the ballad (more on that in a bit). the EP in its entirety is very fun to listen to tbh. all of the b-sides are pretty alright. though the title track (<i>switch</i>), <i>satisfied</i>, and <i>shame</i> are my favorite ones from here. i honestly don't have a single song in here that i hate. i think that is a massive win.</p>
				<p>despite this being pretty cohesive, the ballad stands out a bit too much and i think it's placement in the tracklist does not help at all. it's a very pretty ballad for sure! but going from piano and violins to a song with the sexiest vocals and guitars i've ever heard takes me fucking out every time i play this. "where would you put the ballad then?" absolutely no clue... maybe in an ideal world this would have worked out a bit better:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>ghost</li>
					<li>switch</li>
					<li>what more can i do?</li>
					<li>살며시 봄이 오면 (the ballad in question)</li>
					<li>shame</li>
					<li>satisfied</li>
				</ol>
				<p>all in all. i think this is a very chill EP! i don't think it brings anything new to the table but it was a nice listen nonetheless. 1 and a half thumbs up.</p>
				<p>also the album cover is so so pretty i love the colors of that pic.</p>

				<p>what a beautiful EP! i've never heard of this artist (or voca producer?) but omg this was so nice to listen to. first thing that caught my attention was the <a href="https://eneiongaku.bandcamp.com/album/-" target="_blank" class="outlink">album cover</a>. <small>you can't see it here because i compress these imgs to hell on purpose</small> but it's a watercolor painting made by inoha and it just radiates exactly what i thought this EP would be like.</p>
				<p>it's so sweet and calm... i think i would love listening to this as i am falling asleep.</p>
				<p>and the way miku's voice is tuned is so LOVELYYYY as well. i am in love.</p>

				<p class="info"><b>date released:</b> 3 april 2024</p>
				<p>me thinks cute! when i first heard the <a title="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/VOaamwhWLPw" target="_blank">teasers</a> for <i>beautiful maze</i> i was expecting something along the lines of liquid dnb. despite my slight disappointment <small>i never learn that you cannot trust kpop teasers</small> the chorus of this song is super pretty tho. overall this is a very nice song but because of taste, i wish i had a little more going on for it! but i don't think it's boring either. its just Nice and that's it.</p>
				<p>b-sides were pretty okay as well. like I AM BIASED OKAY this is after all one of my favorite kpop groups in terms of discography <small>and the parasocial relationship i have with them is crazy</small> but i'm just pretty neutral on all the songs here! i don't hate or love anything here.</p>
				<p>but if anything, this was a pretty cohesive single and i can see why each of these songs are in here. honestly i'm just happy they are back with more music ^_____^</p>

				<p>GASP..........</p>
				<p>like i have mentioned <a href="winter.html#4">previously</a>, i am back on my bullshit. i like to play co-op matches on project sekai and someone picked this song! as i was playing it all i could think about was how pretty this song sounded. it was really like love at first listen.</p>
				<p>i don't even think i have the words to properly describe how heartrenching this song is. like even without the translated <small>idk japanese :(</small> lyrics, the way miku's voice is tuned is just says so much. and i LOVE the parts where it a constant repetition of <i>"i can't breathe"</i>...... and i hate that the beat is in that section is so GOOD because it makes me want to dance BUT I CAN'T IN GOOD CONSCIENCE. it just feels so heavy and full of emotion. average vocaloid moment i know.</p>
				<p>really recommend the MV as well. the animation is super beautiful.</p>
				<p>i think i should get a bit more into pinocchioP as well... i know a lot of ppl love his stuff and i haven't heard much from him <small>(my fault)</small> soo.... maybe i'll listen to the album this song is included in. one day.</p>
				<p>also the nightcord cover of this cover is absolutely not bad? at all???? i am not a fan of prsk covers but wow. they kinda did a great job with this.</p>
