      <p>the past couple of weeks has felt like a rollercoaster of emotions. a friend told me they had been acting a bit distant with me because their significant other thought i was into my friend. i was honestly really hurt when they told me this. not only wasn't that true, i also have a whole girlfriend. it really hurt to know the person you thought you had a nice connection was actually actively trying to not talk to you. even if it was because of outside factors. i was honestly ready to let it all go. this new friend group i had found, the community, my friend. it felt devastating. my girlfriend told me i shouldn't just abandon my friends because of this but i just felt so awful about everything. i really wanted to isolate myself.</p>
      <p>i wanted to give my friend space but the more i thought about it, the more i started to question if my friend really wanted to do this. even if this friendship is over i should let them know that what is happening is not good. as someone in a relationship, i do not think it's normal to ask your partner to cut off a friend just because <i>i</i> feel like that person might be into them. that is not fair for anyone involved. and as hurt as i felt, i really wanted my friend to know this. as i was talking to my friend, everything became more clear. i had been scared that i had misread our connection as a close one. it turns out that this wasn't the case. they also felt close to me in the little time we had known each other. man did i cry so much while talking to them, but i also laughed at the dumb jokes we were making a little after. when our conversation was done i felt a little bit lighter and calmer. i wasn't sure what was gonna happen next, but i was glad i was able to talk to them one more time. we were not born to be put in these type of situations.</p>
      <p>eventually they let me know they had talked to their significant other, and were able to reach a middle ground. we are back to talking and being friends. from this experience i learned a couple of things:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>i am a happier person because these friendships</li>
        <li>people do care and think about me</li>
        <li>talking is the key to <b>any</b> type of relationship</li>
        <li>i am quick to isolate myself from others</li>
        <li>there are things that are worth fighting for</li>
      </ol>
      <p>it's always been a bit difficult for me to connect with people. i'm glad i talked to my friend. and i'm also happy they were able to stand up for our friendship.</p>
