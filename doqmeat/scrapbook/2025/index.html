          lowkey nothing burger movie. built a pretty decent suspense but ??? idk i feel like it never really did anything with it. the age gap is there for a reason and this movie does show how manipulative and dangerous these relationships can be but again. ? idk i just feel like not much happened here tbh. very pretty to look at though.
