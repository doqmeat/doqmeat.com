				<p id="241030"><b>30.oct.24 - 12am</b> woke up today to a laggy af laptop and when i restart it i get an error that my FANS are not working properly...... <img src="/!g/pix/emote1scared.gif" alt=""> opened my laptop up, 1 out of the 2 fans was so so so dusty... i cleaned it up, plug it out and in but it doesn't spin while the other one does. ordered some replacement fans which i hope will fix the fans issue. and i also found out that my laptop was being super slow because the CPU was capping itself at 0.20 ghz... i'm guessing it somehow knows theres an issue with the fans and it's capping itself on purpose so it doesn't get cooked. the weird thing is that my laptop has been WAYYY hotter before and the CPU has never capped itself. but i guess this is a bit different? this laptop was pretty expensive ($1k, for my standards) and its about to be 3 years old next march so i feel like if it kicks the bucket this early, i might actually sob <img src="/!g/pix/emote1crying.gif" alt=""> i have an external mini fan blowing cool air to the back of the laptop and the CPU hasn't capped itself yet. so at least i know <b>it is</b> related to the fans.</p>

				<p><b>29.aug.24 - 12am</b> been learning a bit more and more about python as i go to my compsci class. very basic stuff though. learned how to use my terminal to do python too. not really sure how ppl would prefer (or how it is more convenient?) to code something on a terminal instead of an editor but idk! prof also showed us an online <a href="https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/" target="_blank" class="outlink">compiler</a> we can use, though i think i will stick to my buddy brackets as an editor and use my git bash to display the output.</p>
				<p>which btw, talking about my terminal... i was wondering if there was a way to customize a bit more in-depth how terminals look and it finds out that there actually <i>is</i> a way of doing it! i downloaded <a href="https://ohmyposh.dev/" target="_blank" class="outlink">oh my posh</a> and it works wonderfully on my git bash. i will admit it took me a good second to understand how to set it up but i think it was relatively easy. <button onclick="showPic('!g/240829-bash.jpg','screenshot of my git bash','theres a ton of cool themes but this neko one caught my attention because of the layout. i loved the thought of a little cat speaking to me. another cool thing is that you can also customize these themes however you want. so i added a little GUP! in there because lately i have been pretty obsessed with saying that out loud. in reference of that swimming cat of course.')">!g/240829-bash.jpg</button></p>

				<p><b>04.aug.24 - 10pm</b> i kinda wanna redo my homepage so i've been working on that, but i'm not sure what exactly to do with it!! i know i would like to make it a bit lighter for those with slow connections (like me) and i wanna move my fanlistings and webrings into a separate page too. i might go for something a bit more minimalist? not sure but i would also like to mess around with colors and have different themes for it. we will see!</p>

				<p><b>31.jul.24 - 3pm</b> did a bit of javascript stuff today! learned how to use <code>localStorage</code> and implemented it on my <a href="/blog">blog</a> for the light / dark theme switcher. took me a bit bc the result would end up being <code>null</code> if it was your first time visiting that page so i just simply did a <i>if null do "light theme"</i> and it worked so that's going to be like that until i can learn to do it another way. i also figured i could rewrite the random music ad script on my <a href="/music">music</a> page in a more coherent and efficent way than the one shown from the template i took. <button onclick="showPic('!g/240731-js.jpg','screenshot of code editor','like look at this mess')">!g/240731-js.jpg</button></p>
