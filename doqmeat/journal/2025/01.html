      <h2 class="entry"><span class="title">winter break wrap-up</span><span class="date">20.jan.25</span> <span class="weather"><img src="/journal/weather/sunny.gif" alt="sunny"></span></h2>
      <p><mark>uni classes are about to start pretty soon so i wanna talk about how i spent my winter break.</mark> <small>btw can we talk about how fast time is passing? good lord. for me, it was new year yesterday.</small></p>
      <p>when i first started winter break, i said i would work more on my site but i never did that <img src="https://doqmeat.com/!g/pix/catfall.gif" alt=""> if i'm being quite honest, i didn't have much motivation to work on my site during this time. can't really tell you why that is... i def had the time to work on them. but i just didn't want to... i kinda just wanted to chill for the time being.</p>
      <p>side tangent: but i've also been having problems with spam on my chat and guestbook soooo i will def be taking out the chatbox next time i update the homepage. and replace the guestbook with <a href="https://atabook.org/" target="_blank" class="outlink">atabook</a> so moderation can be easier. don't really mind these changes that much. but it's def just a bit annoying <img src="https://doqmeat.com/!g/pix/catfire.gif" alt=""> i don't really wanna be checking my site on the daily to see if someone wrote down a new slur or a random ass link. though i do smile at the messages i get that aren't either of these things. thank you to those <img src="https://doqmeat.com/!g/pix/heart5.png" alt=""></p>
      <p>ANYWAYS. my winter break. besides getting sick, i had a lot of fun at a amusement park (a very very small amusement park) that opens up every december. the attractions weren't all that good and honestly most of them were just what i call "dizzy machines". but again, i had fun.</p>

      <p>already talked about this in my previous log but i did spend like a good half of my winter break sick. because of this i watched a couple of things like <i>revolutionary girl utena</i> and my yearly rewatch of <i>madoka magica</i> and <i>rebellion</i>. watching so much shit about magical girls, i kinda entered into a madoka hyperfixation <small>(that i am still going through to this day but a bit more lowkey.)</small> i bought <i>rebellion</i> digitally and even thought about getting the blu-ray but i'm a bit scared of getting one that is region locked. and i run with an older blu-ray player too so i think it's best to hold on on that one.</p>
      <p>i watched some super interesting essays about the series as well which i will be sharing here because i was honestly just so invested in these and i feel like i learned so much. the video essays in question are <a href="https://youtu.be/jwMFS0NcR_U?si=Jz7MmnuUBBxG77AS" target="_blank" class="outlink">On Werther, Faust, and Love: an analysis of Madoka Magica through the works of Goethe</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRYrrCalsyw" target="_blank" class="outlink">"Beyond Good and Evil" - Encomium of Homura (on Nietzsche, Camus, and love)</a>, both made by the same person! because of these videos i also learned that there is a tie in manga spinoff about the events between the anime and rebellion called <i>puella magi madoka magica: wraith arc</i> and i am super super close to finish reading it.</p>
      <img title="me playing balatro and new vegas at the same time." src="/scrapbook/2025/balatronnewvegas.png" width="40%" class="left">
      <p>as for video games, i'm still playing the same stuff. EXCEPT i smoked some of that <b>balatro</b> crack. that game is crazy fun though i do feel like i am a tiny bit stupid for it. but that's fine.</p>
      <p>i got to resume my <a href=" /vgs/games/fallout-new-vegas/index.html" target="_blank">fallout new vegas</a> save which i'm pretty sure i hadn't properly played since summer 2024. i got all of the DLCs since i'm pretty much (almost) done with the main storylines but my girlfriend recommended me to get the DLCs first before finishing the main game. whatever you say, beautiful. been really back at it though! hopefully i'll keep playing it on my free time when i start studying again. but man i feel like i can in new vegas for hoursssss. what a fun game man.</p>
      <p>started watching <i>twin peaks the return</i> with my girlfriend and we've been having such a blast. this show is fucking scary and insane and i love it so much. i was so sad when i found out about david lynch's passing :( <i>twin peaks</i> has been the only work of his that i've been familiarized with but from videos i've seen and even to his silly acting in the show, he just seems like a very cool dude. rest in peace david lynch <img src="https://doqmeat.com/!g/pix/sad.gif"></p>
      <p>after watching the <a title="opening of season 1" href="https://youtu.be/NmS3m0OG-Ug?si=kq6o_oviqhLI6WeJ" target="_blank" class="outlink">animated</a> opening of a TV show called <i>severance</i> i got super curious and started watching it yesterday. it if safe to say that i binge watched the entire thing. and oh my god that show was so fun to watch. now i just gotta keep up with the weekly episodes but WOW. it holds such an interesting premise.</p>
      <p>i've been having a lot of fun too spending so much time with my little meow meow <b>steve minecraft</b>. he's gotten so big too!!!! i really appreciate his company. my silly.</p>
      <center><img src="!g/250120-steve.png" alt="steve minecraft the cat" width="90%"></center>
      <p>i think that is pretty much it! been hanging out with my wonderful girlfriend. trying to get back in the groove of listening to new music more often as well. i am currently in love with <b>asian glow</b>'s <a href="https://dbeatdropdeadpowerhead.bandcamp.com/album/11100011" target="_blank" class="outlink">11100011</a>. i am very excited to see the 2 friends i have made on campus once again! we coordinated to take the same classes together so at least there is that to look forward to among other things :3 peace and love, everyone.</p>

      <h2 class="entry"><span class="title">i am tired, but also a bit joyful</span><span class="date">01.jan.25</span> <span class="weather"><img src="/journal/weather/sunny.gif" alt=""></span></h2>
      <h3>tired</h3>
      <p>i think i have spent the majority of december sick. within the last two months, i have gotten sick 3 times... <img src="/!g/pix/catsob.gif" alt=""> 2 times with a cold, and then i got the flu. i blame my retail job for all 3 times i got sick. it sucks. specially when you're sick and you have to go to work like that or else they'll remove attendance points out of your profile which can make you get terminated. i love life. i don't ever wanna work while sick but it's either that or getting fired and finding another ass job.</p>

      <h3>joy and whimsy</h3>
      <img src="!g/250101-watch.png" alt="galaxy watch with a cute cat watch face" width="30%" class="left">
      <p>i, at the very least, was able to enjoy the 25th relatively healthy. i spent sometime with my family and my girlfriend. my dad got me a <mark>samsung galaxy watch 6</mark>. my first and previous smart watch was a <a title="img" href="/fashion/!g/misc/fitbit.png" target="_blank">fitbit versa 2</a> watch. it still works wonders to this day. i find it a pretty cute and charming watch overall, but the <i>galaxy watch</i> has a lot of new stuff that my fitbit didn't have. including more apps and a speaker! which means i can now pick up phone calls from my silly ass watch. awesome!</p>

      <p>my beautiful WONDERFUL girlfriend got me this <mark>little prince lego set</mark> ?!?!?!? it took me 2 hours to build it and it was pretty easy! i had never built something like this so this was a very pleasant surprise to me. i actually cried when helena handed it out to me. <i>the little prince</i> is such a precious story to me. i really love this little guy.</p>

      <p>and last but not least, i algo received a beautiful postcard from <a title="arachne's site!" href="https://strawberryreverie.neocities.org/" target="_blank" class="outlink">Arachne</a>!</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="!g/250101-mizu.png" alt="pencil drawing of mizu which a bunch of stickers by arachne">
        <figcaption>just wanted to share the amazing drawing she did of mizu here. <img src="/!g/pix/heart2.gif"></figcaption>

      <h3>tired, again</h3>
      <img src="/tv/!g/utena.png" alt="revolutionary girl utena poster" style="max-width: 100%;" class="right">
      <p>then the next day my whole body started aching. uh oh. this time it was a <u>type A flu</u>. given that it is more severe than just a cold, i did stay home instead of sacrificing myself (AND OTHER PEOPLE...) by going to work. and man. do i miss being in my bed while sick.</p>
      <p>i took advantage of this and started watching things i've been meaning to watch for a while. i managed to finish <i>revolutionary girl utena</i> as well as <i>adolescence of utena</i>. and let me just tell you. wow. that really was art. it left me with the same feelings that binge watching <i>madoka magica</i> back in 2016 made me feel. speechless and a little bit confused. because of this, i am also in the middle of watching the madoka movies (<i>beginnings</i> and <i>eternal</i>) since i've never watched them because it's just the same as the anime but with a few extra steps. and that night all of a sudden...</p>
      <h3>happy ne- *explodes like a power generator*</h3>
      <p>during the morning of december 31st there was a <a title="Nearly all of Puerto Rico is without power on New Year’s Eve" href="https://apnews.com/article/puerto-rico-power-outage-b594dc464d469b812dc9b65c76cc16e9" target="_blank" class="outlink">massive blackout throughout Puerto Rico</a> because of the incompetent company that handles our power grid. sigh. i spent 27 hours with no electricity. during new year's of all days. lovely.</p>
      <p>i went outside during midnight, the entire street was just pitch black, but people still lighted up those fireworks they have been waiting to light up til now. i didn't have a lot of phone signal for the majority of the day so i just said "happy new year" to <a href="../2024/11.html#23">steve</a> and went back to bed to listen to my CDs. having a battery power CD player and a couple of your favorite albums WILL save you.</p>
      <h3>so, how was my 2024?</h3>
      <p>honestly i got a lot done this year. you can see a pretty well summarized retelling of the past year on my <a href="/scrapbook/2024/index.html">scrapbook</a>. it was definitely a bit hectic compared to other years. i still miss my grandma a lot and i think about her almost every day. but i also managed to get back into university and i've been really enjoying my time there. i got to make new friends too! i think it has also helped me to take my mind off a bit from my grandma's passing. nonetheless, i think this year i have been the happiest i have ever been in a while. and to me that is a huge achievement.</p>
      <p>this year i also got a WHOLE lot more of messages regarding my site. thank you very much to everyone who has written me a nice message <img src="/!g/pix/emote1happy2.gif" alt=""> even if i don't answer it, i still appreciate them.</p>
      <p>for 2025 i am hoping to fully develop my brain and also get my first tattoo.</p>
