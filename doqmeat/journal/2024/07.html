			<p>hello everyone! last time i wrote a log i was in arizona, but now i'm back in puerto rico :3</p>
			<p>so first thing you're going to notice if you are reading this is that i updated my journal page layout! i still love the <a title="img of v2.5" href="/notebook/archive/layouts/240303-journal.jpg" target="_blank">little notepad look of the past one</a>, but i really needed a change of scenery after having that one since may 2023! i took a lot of inspiration from my <small>currently unused</small> <a href="https://doqmeat.blog.fc2.com/" target="_blank" class="outlink">FC2 blog</a> and v4 of <a href="https://komichi.neocities.org" target="_blank" class="outlink">komichi's site</a>! i wanted to go for a more relaxed??? or i guess something a little bit easier on the eyes since this is a very paragraph heavy page afterall. i also just wanted a layout similar to that of a blog! hence the inspiration from my FC2 blog. either way, i love changing stuff around every once in a while and i'm pretty satisfied with this look!</p>
			<p>it basically functions the same as v2. the iframes are still here and they are not going away. but i did implement a calendar iframe on the sidebar that i will update manually every time i write a log! this way i can link a log's heading in the calendar and you will be taken to the log i wrote that day! i also added some arrows into the iframe so you can toggle between different months. it's nothing fancy. literally just a table with numbers, but i do think it's pretty neat and it's not <b>that</b> tedious to update. there's probably Some way to do that automatically but that probably involves a lot of stuff that i have 0 knowledge on at the moment. oh, also the calendar is in spanish! i thought it would be a nice details to do that.</p>
			<p>at a later update i will probably add the music player back with some new songs :3</p>
			<hr>
			<p>in other news... i have an interview pretty soon :] yes, it's for retail... <img src="/!g/pix/cattire.gif"> i'm honestly not that crazy about working in retail again after seeing so many horrors but that extra income would be <b>really</b> nice so i can save it for my uni tuition. i just hope i don't cringefail the interview. i get so nervous in interviews despite having done so much at my retail previous job. so i should be okay and get this job! it's honestly a miracle i even have an interview tbh. i've been applying to sooo many retail jobs the past months but i don't even get called for interviews. and it's crazy because <mark>i already have experience working in retail!!!!!</mark> this shit is crazy bro!!!!!!!!! but whatever honestly. i can't think about it too much or it pisses me off so i let's leave it there. thoughts n prayers for me please.</p>
