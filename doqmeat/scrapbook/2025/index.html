          <summary>+</summary>
          lowkey nothing burger movie. built a pretty decent suspense but ??? idk i feel like it never really did anything with it. the age gap is there for a reason and this movie does show how manipulative and dangerous these relationships can be but again. ? idk i just feel like not much happened here tbh. very pretty to look at though.

      <li class="watched">love me | ★★★★☆ <details>
          <summary>+</summary> i saw a <a href="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTgzYjkzNjUtYmE3NS00YjdlLWEzMzUtMTFiN2E4Njk5NThlXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg" target="_blank" class="outlink" title="jpg of said poster">poster</a> for this movie online from my local theaters and i was like wtf. why is kristen stewart a BUOY and steven yeun a SATELLITE????? and that was really all the information i needed to be intrigued enough to watch the movie. that and the fact that kristen stewart was doing a straight role. so intriguing. objectively this movie is probably just okay. but man that was kind of a crazy ride for me. i definitely laughed a lot. <span class="spoiler">i will say that the animation bit was a bit rough. it was giving a better version of bitmojis. but like if you think about the movie's context then you know. you can let it pass. like if this is the best they could do with the budget they had then this is a pretty decent excuse for that. but this would probably be the only thing that i would bitch about.</span> despite the <span class="spoiler">animation not being the best,</span> i do think the movie was very pretty to look at. anyway. if you are also intrigued i recommend not knowing anything about it. i think it's way more fun that way.
