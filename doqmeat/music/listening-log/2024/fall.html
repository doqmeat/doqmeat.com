            <p>i've had this album on my to-listen-later list based off the sick cover alone. my girlfriend one night told me that she listened to it and that she loved it so it made me want to listen to it the very next day!</p>
            <p>and OHHHH MY GODDD. from start to finish, this was <b>such</b> a wonderful listening experience. i fell like i haven't heard something like this in a while. i love how each song just builds upon the other one and how nice they transition to the next one.</p>
            <p>this just felt so so so magical to me. god i loved this a lot. i wish i was intelligent enough to write more about how this album feels to me. but i feel like i lack the vocabulary to even begin describing in.</p>
            <p>every song is so lovely though i <u>obviously</u> have my favorites. though i think the one that gave the most goosebumps was the outro of <i>the ballad of matt & mica</i>. what a great fucking ending to such a grand album.</p>
            <p>i also got told that i should check out their first album so i will eventually take a listen to that! but i'm seriously overjoyed with this album. i hope to get the CD someday.</p>

            <p>boy have i been letting this marinate for a bit. from the first time i listened to it i really really enjoyed and i knew i was probably gonna listen to it more with time. guys i hate to say it. but at least for me..... the modhaus groups have been putting some banger music that is Just My Type... i of course have my gripes with... their business model (with the objects or whatever they call them man i don't care) but man. this is honestly all i want from K-pop. some nice music. just give 10 more of these and i'll be happy. maybe mix it up a bit but i will still be relatively happy.</p>
            <p>this is just some very enjoyable electropop songs. i don't think this is a perfect album. probably far from it. i think, at least for me, a downside of tripleS is that all of their voices blend very well. like throughout these songs i don't feel like a group is singing them. this just 1 or 2 people singing in my brain <img src="/!g/pix/emote1crying.gif"> and like that is not That Bad. it's kinda whatever. but it is a criticism i have about the group.</p>
            <p>opening the album we have a great opener with <i>S</i>. the guitar in this track is just sick. this is probably their best intro. it is just so nice and groovy. with some hints here and there leading up to the title: <i>girls never die</i>. perfect.</p>

            <p>i think <i>girls never die</i> as a title track does the job well enough. la la la la la. have i ever mentioned how i much i love their <u>la la la</u>'s? i think it took me 3 tripleS EPs to figure out they were doing it on purpose. like with an actual purpose. they didn't just love singing la la la la every once in a while. i found it quite funny at first but i've gotten used to it.</p>
            <p>the b-sides of this album are pretty alright! honestly i do think they are all pretty nice, but the one that stuck from the very first listen was <i>24</i> NOW THAT... that is one hell of a song. a lot of people call it <a href="https://youtu.be/3TQd2ahq6oU?si=Qa7xpUZAiLk3bpQm" target="_blank" class="outlink">rising 2.0</a>. and not only does it make sense. but the demo for <i>24</i> is literally called <a href="https://youtu.be/igERFBQzbko" target="_blank" class="outlink">recover it now</a> and you know what? yeah. this might be rising's sister. but i don't care. i truly do think this is the best damn song on this album. one day i decided to look up the <a href="https://youtu.be/FBsc6L_ucxY?si=llO4c3Gfrr35VcvK&t=37" target="_blank" class="outlink">instrumental</a> for the song and my jaw DROPPED when i heard the fucking <u>la la la</u>'s used in the instrumentation. that is so catchy and clever. UGH. i need these kpop companies to release instrumentals because I LOVEEEE listening to them so much and finding out stuff like this.</p>
            <p>sorry to the other b-sides... they are all very enjoyable on their own. but <i>24</i> definitely was a love at first listen type of song.</p>
            <p>anyways, that's all i gotta say about this. some very solid stuff in here!</p>
