      <p>working in retail truly is hell. idk if it's a skill issue, but i am currently sick once again. last time i was sick was literally 1 week ago. i think so far i've been sick 4 times this year. well 5 times if you count being sick during new years. and yes i will blame it all on my retail job. if it isn't the clients, it's probably my coworkers going to work sick because they probably can't afford to not go and not get money. at least that's what i want to think. but if it's the clients, then please go kill yourself. no need to be there sick. </p>
      <p>anyway, i really need to mask up for that job and probably have a dangling hand sanitizer keychain on my pants because there is simply no other way of dealing with this. i feel a little weak, with a stuffy nose, and a sore throat but at least i don't feel like i'm dying like last time.</p>
      <p>i have a trip planned pretty soon so i guess it's better to get sick right now rather than later. and also thinking about that trip is making me not go into insanity for getting sick twice during my summer break. but still. it really is a pain in the ass to get sick.</p>

      <p>during the time i was sick in june, another <a title="journal log: my beautiful madoka discs" href="06.html#1">madoka blu-ray set</a> had arrived so i could finally complete my PMMM collection! <small>or at least somewhat.</small></p>

        <figcaption>front and back covers of the PMMM movie blu-ray material book. so cute. </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>this one includes: both PMMM movies: <i>beginnings</i> and <i>eternal</i>, the soundtrack CD, and a little book just like the <i>rebellion</i> set. while rewatching eternal i noticed that the scene where madoka and homura are naked in space got censored (by putting them in some very blurry and dreamy white dresses) which honestly thank god. i had never really noticed that when i first watched <i>eternal</i>.</p>

      <p>the time i've spent sick during my summer break has not been the best but at least it gives me more time to do stuff i don't usually do often like watching movies that are on my <a title="letterboxd watchlist" href="https://letterboxd.com/doqmeat/watchlist/" target="_blank" class="outlink">watchlist</a>. my god did i watch <a title="june scrapbook page with all the movies logged!" href="/scrapbook/2025/index.html#jun" target="_blank">so many movies</a>. i also have a little sticky note on the wall behind my desk with stuff i want to accomplish this summer. here's some stuff on that list:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><s>make a <a href="https://doqmeat.github.io/js-walkman-mp3-player/" target="_blank" class="outlink">walkman js mp3 player</a></s></li>
      </ul>
      <p>i had such a fun time doing the mp3 player. i kind of built it right besides my girlfriend as she was playing deltarune. seeing the 2d walkman player made me want to buy one 2nd hand on ebay. i have SO many mp3 files on my computer. but all the ones that were within my budget were in japanese and i dont understand japanese! maybe it was a sign from god. so realistically, i simply ended up buying a 128gb micro sd card so i can put all of my mp3 files there and listen to it on my phone. next up is finding a good mp3 player app on android but that is a problem for another day.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><s>work through the frontend roadmap</s></li>
      </ul>
      <p>ideally, i wanted to get started on something backend related but where i'm at in the roadmap i am currently learning the ropes of <a title="link to the tutorial i'm following" href="https://javascript.info" target="_blank" class="outlink">javascript</a> and honestly i'm okay with that + i've also been having a bit of fun <small>not sure how long that will last but oh well.</small> it's very nice to see the concepts learned in class and being able to apply them here and thanks to that experience, be able to go a little bit more in-depth with it. it's very interesting learning a programming language that isn't statically typed since i learned <small>learning*</small> to program with C++. i feel like once summer break ends and i once again have to use C++ in class, it's going to be a bit tricky since i already feel so used to JS, but it shouldn't be that hard to make the switch tbh.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>finish playing <a href="/vgs/games/fallout-new-vegas/" target="_blank">fallout new vegas</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>honestly i might change the game to <a href="/vgs/games/bloodborne/index.html" target="_blank">bloodborne</a> i've been REALLY into bloodborne as of late compared to new vegas. i've never been a fan of completing a game for the sake of being done with it and moving on. i really like to immerse myself in the stuff i play, and right now that game is bloodborne. i'm a little bit hesitant to put it as a to-do item tbh. cus i feel like i'm pretty slow at the game and i don't wanna rush it through. i'll see if i can finish it but if not, that's okay.</p>
      <p>though i felt like i should go into new vegas and see what's up for a bit. i started the <i>honest hearts</i> DLC and it's been pretty alright so far. something i really like is the change of scenery.</p>

        <figcaption>i really like the tribe's paintings and such.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <ul>
        <li>go to the beach</li>
      </ul>
      <p>i really need to go to the beach!!!! once i'm done being sick i'll probably go on my own someday :p</p>
