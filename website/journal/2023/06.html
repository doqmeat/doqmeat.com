<p>finding joy in the little things like cooking my own dishes and going yum
<p style="overflow:hidden;"><img src="!g/230628-food1.jpg" width="50%" align="left" style="padding-right:5px;"> so this is some rice i found in the frozen isle, i think its called korean style fried rice. i added some more onions (white and green) and poured a stir fry sauce i have while i was cooking it on the pan and MAN it taste so good. i need to learn how to make this with white rice. and porkchop. and salad. yay! this is from today
<p style="overflow:hidden;"><img src="!g/230628-food2.jpg" width="50%" align="right"> and for this dish i did some mashed potatoes, used a bit of gravy. chicken gravy...... i meant to pick mushroom greavy at the supermarket but i picked chicken gravy by accident.... <img src="/!g/pix/catfall.gif"> oh well it was pretty good. and some chicken with, again, cooked with that stir fry sauce. im kinda obsessed with that stir fry sauce
<p>i need to learn more recipes and stuff. i should learn how to properly cook rice bc wow the many things you can do with rice is fascinating. but every time i do some plain ol white rice its kinda... just ok. so i need to practice my rice cooking skill.

<p id="23" class="date">23.jun.23</p>
<p>diary log update! i am trying to hold it all together <img src="/!g/pix/emote13dots.gif"> but i do wanna share some things i've done / seen the past week!

<p>i think first thing i wanna share is that ive been getting into <mark>neko atsume</mark>... again!!! <br><center><img title="meow meows" src="!g/230623-neko.jpg" width="80%"></center><br>i havent played it in such a while. i really missed those silly little cats on my phone<br><center><img src="!g/230623-neko1.jpg" width="30%"></center>
<p>so yeah i've been having a lot of fun with that! i look at them and i smile. its very simple

<p style="overflow:hidden;vertical-align:center;"><img src="!g/230623-mob.jpg" width="30%" align="left" style="padding-right:10px;"> my boyfriend got me this adorable mob (from <mark>mob psycho 100</mark>) plushie for my bday!!!! he is so cute. el wiwi


<p>i've been rewatching some of my all time fav movies like <mark>wall-e</mark> and <mark>surf's up</mark>!
<p>i ordered a bluray of <b>surf's up</b> on ebay for like $5 (what a steal...) because WOW i just love this movie so so so much. to me? it is perfect. i honestly just love the whole mockumentary style and how damn well they make it work for a animated cg movie. i cant wait for the disk to arrive so i can watch the bonus features. its so interesting watching the behind the scenes and listening to the director's commentary for my fav movies. i love knowing the bits of how they were made. which now brings me to wall-e.
<p>i love <b>wall-e</b>. i remember watching it in theaters. and it was amazing. i really loved it. i loved it so much that my parents got me the blu ray of it as a christmas gift that same year. that i still own (and it still works given how scratched that disk is LOL) to this day, 13 years later!!!!! its one of those that have a bonus disk with the bonus features so thats what i've been watching for the past 2 days. and it so cool to see all the progress and how it was made.
<br><img src="!g/230623-walle2.jpg" width="50%"><img src="!g/230623-walle1.jpg" width="50%">
<p>also watched the movie with the director's (andrew stanton) commentary. very cool stuff. and what i love about this version is that it also showed me concept art throught the commentary as well! so cool. something interesting i learned is that he didnt really have in mind to make a movie with humanity in it. it was actually supposed to be aliens! thats why the humans in wall-e look like... blobs i'd say.
<p>while explaining wall-e's child like wonder, he was saying how he remembers looking at a eyelash curler when little and thinking that was some torture device and i was like ??? bc I ALSO THOUGHT THE SAME THING! that was so funny. did any of you also thought that it was a torture device when you were little?
<p>besides that he also mentioned that he didnt exactly have an agenda (lol) with the story of wall-e lol but, and i quote <blockquote><i>"we had fun poking at large corporations, i mean we work for one"</i></blockquote> and i found that so fucking funny. i giggled


<p>onto another topic, i just wanna give this artist that is commissioned frequently by epic games to make loading screens for <a title="gaming log for fortnite" href="/vgs/fortnite" target="_parent">fortnite</a>: <a title="linktree" href="https://linktr.ee/ohnosam" target="_blank">sam mckenzie</a>. i love love LOVE their art style so much. its so easily to distinguish too! one of my (many) visual art inspirations. here are some of the loading screens they have done for fortnite

<p>i wanna start off by saying happy pride month!! yesterday i went to see <b>spider-man: across the spiderverse</b> and MANNNNNNNNNN............................. <img src="/!g/pix/catsurprised.gif"> <img src="/!g/pix/emote1lov2.gif"> THAT WAS SO GOODDDDDD HOLY SHIT. that movie was genuinely was of the BEST experiences i've had with like any film. ever. like oh my god. i just. i was so overwheled the entire time and not even in a bad way! i felt i was on edge the entire time bc of the drama. but also this is such a wonderful movie to look and listen to. the colors of this are just so fucking gorgeus. and the music was banging as well. like there was so many parts of the movie where the music REALLY add to it and so much. it was phenomenal. i am completely amazed at how good the spiderverse movies have come out so far. like this is truly a love letter to animation. what a fantastic experience i reallyy do not have the words to tell how good this movie was. if you have the chance please go and watch it!!!! spoilers incoming <span class="spoiler">my heart dropped to the bottom when i saw that miles was "actually" supposed to become prowler in the world where he doesnt get bit by a spider... like fear. i felt so horrible. and i loved it. i loved how horrying it felt to know that everything miles was doing was actually going to hurt even more people.</span> i really cant wait for the 2nd part. which BTW i totally forgot this is a 2 part movie so when my bf told me that the movie would be ending soon soon i was like <i>WHAT? but we just got to the climax</i> JFHNKS. solid 5/5 movie. perfect. i loved the music so much. i need to say it again. usually movie soundtracks come out like a month or so after the theatrical release so I WILL be listening to that and putting it on my listening log.
<br>after that we went and ate at a golden corral. pretty alright place to eat at.
