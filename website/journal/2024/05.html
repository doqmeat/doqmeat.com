			<h1 class="entry"><span class="title">end of 1st uni semester</span><span class="date">04.may.24</span></h1>
			<p>my first uni semester is coming to an end this coming week! it is crazy how fast everything went. not sure if it's because i am doing something with my time or if... time is just like that now. i have learned a lot throughout this semester about myself and other things. there's a lot of stuff i need to work on! despite pushing myself to be less shy in classes, i really want to talk more in the future. i'll get there one day hopefully.</p>
			<p>so far, i really enjoy going to uni. i'm still pretty introverted but i managed to make 2 friends this semester ^_^ we sometimes go and study at an ice cream place near the train, and i went to the mall with my other friend and we also got some ice cream there. the 2 people i've befriended love ice cream. it's very nice. i often tell myself that i like being alone. part of that is true. i love being by myself. it feels very refreshing and peaceful. but the immense happiness these new friendships have given me reminded me that i also like meeting new people and connecting with them. a reminder that i am still a social being to my core.</p>
			<p>even if i'm not very social, i still find the atmosphere of the university very nice. i also enjoy taking the train almost on a daily basis. not having to drive and aste money on a weekly basis on gas has also given me immense joy in my life. i am being very serious. i lowkey hate driving. and not only that, but i find the train rides itself very relaxing. i've been walking way more because of this. which is great because i don't really have the energy to do some Actual exercise nowadays <small>though i am pretty sure i could if i scheduled my time for it</small>.</p>
			<p>all in all, i had a very nice time here. on august i will be taking my first computer science. i'm super curious to take that class and see what they'll be teaching there. so i'm really looking forward to it! i am a little bit nervous <img src="/!g/pix/catsweat.gif" alt="sweating emoji"> but i know i'll be okay at the end of the day.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>with this semester coming to an end i will be free once again to do more stuff in here! i have some <b>blog</b> posts that i've been meaning to publish for a while. though i would also love to keep working on building my siinamota fansite! i have so many fun ideas but we'll see! i also wanna continue playing <a href="/vgs/fallout-1/index.html" target="parent">fallout 1</a> and eventually start a new game in <a href="/vgs/fallout-new-vegas/index.html" target="_parent">new vegas</a>.</p>
			<p>and that's not even all! i'll be visiting my beloved cat <a href="/shrines/mizu/index.html" target="_parent">mizu</a> this summer as well! it's been such a long time since i've seen him... i really can't wait to pet him and give him forehead kisses. i'll be so happy to see him.</p>
