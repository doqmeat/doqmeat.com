		<h1>2023 wholesome direct</h1>

		<p>so as some of you (gamers) may know, its <s>e3 season</s> i mean summer game fest season <s>still cannot believe e3 has been replaced by something else</s> and with that comes new game reveals and such! i actually watched the main presentation of the summer game fest on the 8th of june and i personally got nothing out of it <img src="/!g/pix/catbored.gif"> BUT! i did check out their other schedules on their site and i saw this, <a title="link to their website" href="https://wholesomegames.com" target="_blank"><mark>the wholesome games direct</mark></a>, a <a title="youtube link for the stream!" href="" target="_blank">live stream</a> dedicated to cutesy chill games!! and you know whats the target demographic for this? ME !!!!! <img src="/!g/pix/emote1happy2.gif"> so in this blog i wanna talk about the games that caught my attention that i’ll be looking forward to in the future. lets get started!

			<!------------------------------------------------------->

		<p id="1"><img src="/!g/pix/gayming.gif"> <b>i am a caterpillar</b> <sub>by devfatigued</sub>
		<p class="centered"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Rk52_cZ2nB0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
		<blockquote><small>Crawl up trees, leap between lily pads, and wriggle through underground caverns as you journey towards your destiny as a caterpillar.

		<p>this was the first game that spoke to me. a game about being a caterpillar and exploring the world on the day of your transformation. it seems like its also a game about self identity since the caterpillar does not want to transform into a butterfly and I AM SOO on board with that. i want this. i actually cant wait to play this it looks so cute.

		<p id="2"><img src="/!g/pix/gayming.gif"> <b>pekoe</b> <sub>by kitten cup studio</sub>

		<p>CATS! i think this will be a common theme in this page. im pretty sure that i took note of every game that included cats, and this is one of them! a nice game about making tea for other cats and building your own tea shop!! sounds so wonderful

			<!----------------------------------------------------->
		<p id="3"><img src="/!g/pix/gayming.gif"> <b>bubblegum galaxy</b> <sub>by smarto club</sub>

		<p>another cat!!! the premise of this one just sounds really cool! the puzzle part of this game looks very intriging to me, and i like how you can also know more about the characters and the place as you play it. and the art style looks awesome as well :3
		<p>there's a <mark>demo available on steam</mark> and i got the chance to play it and its pretty fun and charming! i liked the puzzle aspect too, i found it very calming

			<!------------------------------------------------------->

		<p id="4"><img src="/!g/pix/gayming.gif"> <b>sticky business</b> <sub>by spellgarden games</sub>

Time to build the cutest shop on the internet! ~ <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2303350/Sticky_Business/" target="_blank"><i>steam page desc</i></a></small></blockquote>
		<p>you know whats another thing i love besides cats? <mark>STICKERS!</mark> i dont think i have to say anything else like i get to run a small shop where i make stickers and ship them? OKAY!!!! no need to say anything else i am already sold. im very excited for this one

		<p>the art style of this one is just so nice to look at. while i am not exactly the biggest gamer for idle games (example: neko atsume, i just forget about them very easily!) i am willing to give this one a try bc it just looks beautiful and i also read on the website that is inspired by a place in japan called <a title="wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ōkunoshima" target="_blank">Ōkunoshima</a> which has a lot of bunnies!!! and it is also being developed by a single person. i have a lot of respect for solo devs. jess yu has clearly poured a lot of love into this so i really wanna check it out when its ready!
