			<h2 class="entry"><span class="title">mini update</span> <span class="date">23.sep.23</span></h2>
			<p>hi everyone! just wanted to give yall some updates! im working on a couple of pages (including ones that have been in the making for the past month or so...) which is why there hasn't been a lot going on in my site at the moment. i've also been a bit occupied with real life believe it or not!
				<br>i think i am starting to get my shit together... doing some research and all of that so i can start my uni studies once again! im a bit scared but i am also pretty excited for whats about to come. it feels like i am doing progress.
			</p>

			<p>i'm STILL working on my <a class="outlink" href="https://codepen.io/doqmeat/pen/wvQZByN" target="_blank">fav albums</a> page. slowly but surely doing a progress with that one! i want to write as much as i can about why these albums mean so much to me which is why its taking such a long time to finish. i've also discovered that i'm just a pretty slow writer overall <img src="/!g/pix/cateepyy.gif"> it takes me a while to organize my thoughts so that also probably it as well</p>

			<p>i've also decided to put my <a class="outlink" href="https://codepen.io/doqmeat/pen/poqrRdZ" target="_blank">CD collection</a> in to a seperate page rather than being together with my fav albums. i think this will make it look less crowded. and much nicer too. it also has a diffent layout than my fav albums since i don't plan on using javascript for this one. hovering the album covers will give you all the info you need!</p>

			<p>another page i've been working on is my <a class="outlink" href="https://codepen.io/doqmeat/pen/NWevezJ" target="_blank">photobook</a>! been meaning to make this page SINCE the creation of my site. i created it from scratch and as you will notice, it has a similar layout to the CD collection page! trying to figure out how to have the caption boxes inside of the pics was a bit of a trial and error situation but at the end i managed to make it work!! it's a very nice feeling when something like that happens.

			<p>i also have 2 listens to log: <i>loossemble's self titled ep</i> and yeule's <i>softscars</i>. i feel like before i just to gave out quick comments on the things that i listened to on my <a href="/music/2023/0901" target="_blank">listening log</a>. but recently, i've been meaning to make my logs over there a bit more fleshed out compared to how i was previous times. which is why i can't publish these the same day i listen to them, because it takes a while to write them! </p>

			<p>i've been meaning to start working on v3 of my homepage for a while now! i have an idea of what i want to do. but first, i want to finish these things so i can move on to working on that. honestly i try to not work on a lot of stuff at the same time so i don't get overwhelmed, but i also tend to get a bit overburned if i work on a single thing for weeks. but i think i've found a pretty good balance for this problem :)</p>

			<p>i think that concludes my mini update. i went to buy some plantains yesterday and this guy greeted me</p>

			<p class="f-fix">
				<img src="!g/230916-new-fit.jpg" width="40%" align="right" style="margin:10px">
				a department store recently opened that is reletively close to where i live and i decided to check it out!
				<br><br>
				i was able to find a SUPER cute hello kitty shirt, and these <mark>baggy pants</mark>. i have been in search for some baggy pants for MONTHS now, and i was so happy i was able to find these at a decent price AND that fit me very nicely!!!!
				<br><br>
				i always find it so hard to find nice and cute clothes that fit me when i go to shops, since i don't like shopping online for clothes. so i am SUPER happy with this find!
			</p>
			<p class="f-fix">
				<img src="!g/230916-fit.jpg" width="40%" align="left" style="margin:10px">
				this is the fit i wore that day i went shopping, really like it :3 specially the black bodysuit shirt ?? i hope its called that but whatever we ball. i recently found some in a store and bought a couple. they are so nice.
				<br><br>lately, i've just been feeling more confident in myself and the clothes i like to wear :) it's really nice to just stop giving a fuck sometimes. and i think this has to do with the fact that not long ago i came to terms with my gender identity and expression!
			</p>
			<p>for a while, i had known that i don't exactly feel like a "girl", but i wasn't exactly sure how to describe my relationship with gender with just a word or two. its a bit complicated. <b>but right now i'm fine with calling myself nonbinary :) and that makes me happy</b>. it feels pretty freeing in a way... that i don't have to conform to something that i don't want to be.
			</p>
			<p>i don't wanna jinx it, but just overall, i've been feeling... happier <img src="/!g/pix/emote1bubbles.gif"> i think i have somewhat of an idea as to what i wanna do with my life after speding the past 3 years or so in a limbo not knowing what to do. or i guess at least now i know where i want to start at, since i don't have everything planned out. but thats okay. before, i was just following along what people told me that i "<u>should</u>" be doing. now, <mark>i want to take better control of my life</mark>. and <mark>make the best out of it while i'm still here!</mark> that is my new goal.</p>

				i also stopped at my fav frapp√© place after being that hello kitty shirt and pants. i ordered a nutella one with a fucking cheesecake on the top?!? i had a bit of trouble eating the cheesecake since i forgot to ask for a spoon (LMAO) but it was so delicious!!! <img src="/!g/pix/eat.gif">

			<p><span style="font-size:big;font-weight:bold;">well. its over</span> <img src="/!g/pix/catsob1.gif"> <img src="/!g/pix/catsob1.gif"> <img src="/!g/pix/catsob1.gif"></p>
			<p>i replaced the ps4's antenna in hopes that would fix its issues with the wifi / bluetooth connection but nope. none of my controllers want to connect to it. sigh... id love to check if it's able to connect to the wifi but i CAN'T because i can't get past the start up menu... WHICH I NEED MY CONTROLLER FOR!! </p>
			<p>man :( i talked about this on a previous log entry titled "<a href="/journal/2023/08#18" target="_blank">7 year old ps4</a>" but despite not playing as much as i did before, my ps4 was my main way of playing video games without making my laptop or switch lite suffer. and i do not have any money or even a job (as im struggling to find one lol) to buy a next gen console. so that kinda sucks. i was really liking <a href="/vgs/bloodborne" target="_blank">bloodborne</a> too, since that was the only game i was playing at the moment on my ps4. i guess i'll finish it someday in the far FAR future.</p>

			<p>yesterday i bought some cheap car washing stuff. so today <mark>i managed to get up early and wash my car</mark> <img src="/!g/pix/gahh.gif"> everyone please clap! that car has not been washed in the past 2 years and it needed a REALLY good cleanup. took me like 3 good hours. but i am very happy that i did so! this feels like a huge accomplishment to me and you know what? i'll take it!!! <img src="/!g/pix/catsurprised.gif"></p>
			<p>i've been waking up a whole lot earlier recently as well! and making myself delicious breakfasts. i love breakfast. so im happy for that as well</p>
			<p>i started watching that <b>fionna and cake</b> spinoff show too. i've been meaning to watch <b>adventure time</b> first tho... but since i noticed fionna and cake is gonna be a weekly thing i've been watching adventure time as well while i wait for the new episodes. and man. does it take me back!!! i kinda miss those days. i'm on season 1 episode 13 so far and i've been having a lot of fun it. mostly watching while im doing the dishes tho BUT IM PAYING attention i promise. i missed finn and jake a bit from my teen years <img src="/!g/pix/catroll.gif"></p>
			<p>the past couple of days have been pretty nice for me all things considered. i hope it keeps being that way for a while</p>

			<h2 class="entry"><span class="title">an unexpected journey while buying a new journal</span> <span class="date">02.sep.23</span></h2>
			<p>yesterday i woke up weirdly missing my bullet journal days... which is pretty weird for me given how self-aware i am about the fact that bullet journals don't work for me because all i care about is decorating the pages <img src="/!g/pix/skull.gif">
			<p>anyway, i was actually writing a log about the different journals and planners i've had over the years but it got pretty long (and im not even done lol) so i will leave it for a blog post in the future! Ôºà„ÄÇÔºæ‚ñΩÔºæÔºâ</p>
			<p><img alt="cover of a small notebook. it has a stylized drawing of a cat lying on a mat with its eyes closed" src="!g/230901-cutejournal.jpg" width="50%" align="right" style="margin:10px;">since the start of 2023, i haven't really done much journaling with paper + pen (for reasons i will discuss on future blog post) so i wanted to start fresh and get a new notebook so i could get back on track! as i was searching for notebooks and journals that i could use for my journaling, i found this SUPER cute one!</p>
			<p>i got really curious about the illustration because i genuinely love it so much so i did some digging with google images trying to find the original source of this illustration so i could find the artist's name and see more of their work!</p>
			<p>while looking for some sort of source through google lens (horrible btw i need to look for another reverse img search engine) i stumbled upon what looked like a japanese website and i said to myself okay this HAS to be it, and it was!!!! <img src="/!g/pix/emote1heh.gif"></p>

			<p><small><img src="/!g/pix/caution1.gif"> disclaimer: the info im about to talk about was machine translated, sorry for any errors („Éé„Å∏Ôø£„ÄÅ) </small></p>

			<p>i was able to find the original source of the picture japanese online shop called <a class="outlink" href="https://wadouraku.co.jp" target="_blank">wadouraku.co.jp</a> <mark>that specializes in selling stylized postcards and message cards</mark>!!! this shop was so so lovely to browse. my favorite part is that the site features a catalog of postcards with beautiful illustrations made by different artists! accdording to site's description, they have 70 affiliated illustrators <img src="/!g/pix/catsurprised.gif"> and each of them has their own page with a little bio section while also showcasing the art they have made for the products. i really recommend checking the site out if you want some art insp cus i genuinely found this to be so cool. i love postcards.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wadouraku.co.jp/SHOP/90-921.html" target="_blank"><img title="click to go to postcard's page" alt="a japanese stylized illustration of cats sitting on a mat outside surrounded by cherry blossoms. they are seen smiling and dancing around in japanese clothing such as kimonos" src="/art/!g/insp/yumiko-kobayashi/cat-postcards-by-yumiko-kobayashi%20(10).jpg" width="40%" align="left" style="margin:10px"></a>
				the person who illustrated the cute cat cover i shared above is <b>„Åì„Å∞„ÇÑ„Åó„ÇÜ„Åø„Åì / yumiko kobayashi</b>! as i was browsing through her <a class="outlink" href="https://wadouraku.co.jp/SHOP/837454/list.html" target="_blank">shop page</a>, i found her bio to be so sweet <img src="/!g/pix/catheart1.gif">
				<br><br>yumiko worked for an animation production company. later in 2007 she started working as an illustrator. she had an interest in drawing since she was a child. when describing her inspirations she mentions other people's works, her own experiences, books, movies, and more. her favorite painter is <a class="outlink" title="wikipedia article" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utagawa_Kuniyoshi" target="_blank">utagawa kuniyoshi</a>
				<br><br><a href="https://wadouraku.co.jp/SHOP/90-944.html" target="_blank"><img title="click to go to postcard's page" alt="a japanese stylized illustration of two cats with traditional japanese clothing with oni masks. one has a drum while holding drum sticks and the other one is doing a handstand" src="/art/!g/insp/yumiko-kobayashi/cat-postcards-by-yumiko-kobayashi%20(8).jpg" width="40%" align="right" style="margin:10px"></a>
				here's a machine-translated excerpt from her bio that i found very heartwarming
			</p>
			<blockquote>"I try to create a world that is enjoyable for the viewer. It is my greatest pleasure when I am able to give form to my thoughts.
				<br>I am very happy when I can give shape to what I have in my mind."

			<p>let me tell you, as i was browsing her catalog, my smile was so big <img src="/!g/pix/emote1bubbles.gif"> <mark>her illustrations are just so fun and colorful and so full of life!!!!</mark> i was in awe the entire time. i know i am a bit biased when it comes to cats but i am IN LOVE with her work. my fav series of hers are her <a href="https://wadouraku.co.jp/SHOP/951649/list.html" target="_blank">cat seasons postcards</a> where she illustrated a postcard for each month of the year showcasing cats doing various activities according to the month! its so cuteeee.</p>

			<p>and i have SO much more illustrations that i absolutely love but for now i will just share these! please go to her page and check her illustrations! it brought a smile to my face. i would do anything to get my hands on these postcards but the shop doesn't seem to ship worldwide <img src="/!g/pix/cattire.gif"> i would also try to contact the shop and ask but i honestly prefer death than to write them a msg with a machine translator UGHHHH. i really need start learning japanese someday</p>
			<p>and i hope „Åì„Å∞„ÇÑ„Åó„ÇÜ„Åø„Åì is having the best day ever. thank you for your art. really wanna print some of these for my own personal use and hang em up on my room. i look at these and i just can't help but smile</p>
			<p>anyway back to buying stationary... i also bought a really cute tulip pen the past week alongside some gel ink pen refills and i can't wait for it to arrive! i'll def share a pic here when it does!</p>
