		<p><span class="date">07.jul.24</span> suddenly remembered that i need to promote this game because i played the demo during july 2023 after seeing it on the 2023 wholesome direct and even made a blog post about the games that caught my attention <a href="/blog/2023/230610-wholesomegames#17" target="_parent">here</a>!</p>
		<img src="demo-1%20(3).jpg" width="100%">
		<p>when starting the demo, i had to navigate the menu in chinese but i still managed to find my way into the game. this isn't my first rodeo with a video game clearly <img src="/!g/pix/catsob.gif" alt=""> i'm still not sure where i can change the language or if that was a bug of the demo.... ANYWAYS. i played the demo for a solid 30 mins. and it was <b>so much fun!!!!!!</b> i fell absolutely in love with the mechanics of the player AKA <b>a cat with a butter toast <small>(or jam toast? might have changed recently cus there's something red on my toast when i played the demo...)</small> stuck to them.</b> this is genius. this is innovative. this is what i'm fucking talking about. i also adore the art style they are going for this, it's so adorable.</p>

		<img src="demo-1%20(2).jpg" width="100%">
		<p>some puzzles / levels got me thinking for quite a bit and some of them got really interesting quirks to them! i really hope to see this game released someday! the team seems really small and i don't see much of this game anywhere else which is why i said <small>jokingly</small> that i needed to promote this because i really want to play this some day! so i highly recommend playing the demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1999520/CATO_Buttered_Cat/" target="_blank">steam</a> :]</p>
