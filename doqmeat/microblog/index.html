				<p><b>08.jul.24 - 7pm</b> just messed aroung a little bit with <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/" target="_blank" class="outlink">eleventy</a> for a bit thanks to this <a href="https://whiona.weblog.lol/2023/10/my-neocities-workflow:-using-eleventy-and-the-cli-to-speed-up-development" title="My Neocities workflow: using Eleventy and the CLI to speed up development by Whiona" target="_blank" class="outlink">guide</a> by <a href="https://whiona.me/" target="_blank" class="outlink">whiona.me</a>. i can see it coming in pretty handy for some cases, but i think <small>as mentioned in the guide!</small> i won't be getting much use of it since i like to add minor decorations and such to pages where <i>i could</i> use it like my <a href="/vgs">gaming log</a>, <a href="/blog">blog</a>, and <a href="/journal">journal</a>. but either way it's cool that i learned something new.</p>

				<p><b>19.jun.24 - 11pm</b> installed ruby and i've been messing with the neocities CLI. this shit is crazy. it does the job without me having to use github so there's that. but using a different terminal rather than git bash is a very minor annoyance. been also trying to create a git hook as shown <a href="https://neocities.org/cli" target="_blank">here</a> but i can't exactly get it to work. argggg. another day then.</p>
