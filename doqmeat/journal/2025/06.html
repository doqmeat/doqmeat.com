      <p>after owning a PS4 from dec 2016 - jul 2023 and having my PS5 for a month, i have some thoughts that i wanted to share:</p>
      <h3>things that piss me off</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><b>the video editor sucks ass</b>. it's harder to cut the video where you want it to because during the preview there's no longer an option to cut the video where you left off. idk how to explain it well but trust me. it's just harder to edit videos on the console now...</li>
        <li><b>no PS5 second screen app</b>. there's an app (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playstation.mobile2ndscreen&hl=en" target="_blank" class="outlink">PS4 second screen</a>) you can use to connect your phone to your PS4 so you can type with your phone's keyboard on the PS4. that has yet to be implemented on the PS5. they do have this app for <a title="google play store" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playstation.remoteplay&hl=en" target="_blank" class="outlink">remote play</a> which is compatible for both PS4 and PS5 and it does let me type with my phone but WHYYY why why why do i have to stream the game to my phone and make it disconnect my wireless controller when i just want to use my phone's keyboard.</li>
        <li><b>no custom themes for the home menu</b>. i always thought that the PS4 custom themes were such a neat feature of the console. it was honestly one of the only reasons why you would pre-order games, most of the time they gave you a free custom theme of the game as a thank you for pre-ordering it. it's very sad to see how next gen consoles are stripping out of their customization features, at least for playstation and nintendo.</li>
        <li><b>removal of digital official manuals / guides under games</b>. on PS4, in the home menu, you could go to a separate section below the game you wanted to play and it would show you official manuals / guides, videos from other people, achievements, DLCs, etc. this was initially how i found out about the <a title="archive.org copy" href="https://archive.org/details/bloodborne-collectors-edition-guide" target="_blank" class="outlink">bloodborne guide</a> i reference every once in a while when i want some help playing it. the PS5 does have all of this <u>except</u> for the manuals / guides. these files were hosted on <a href="https://docs.playstations.com" target="_blank" class="outlink">docs.playstations.com</a> which is currently offline but during june 2023 it was still up and i could browse the official bloodborne guide through my laptop as well on my PS4. i have no clue why they didn't keep this feature since the PS5 can still display web pages. of course it can. <br><br> a theory i have is that during this time, i feel like playstation was getting rid of it's twitter API (for uploading clips and screenshots) bc of elon musk upping up it's prices the solution to this was to have users upload their screenshots and clips to the playstation app, which are stored there for 14 days. i am guessing they got rid of the docs to make more space to store the user's media. but like either way none of this makes since. why are YOU, a multi-billion company, get rid of something in order to make more space for something else. i really don't understand... at the end of the day <mark>docs.playstation.com</mark> was likely taken down just because they probably think nobody was using it. or maybe they DID have the data and saw that at least 3 people were using it. including me. this is starting to get into ramble / rant territory but this removal of digital files really saddened me when i found out the link was dead. this is the reason why i'm greatful for people who take the time to scan, upload, and archive things. i love you all. </li>
        <li>oh yeah <b>they got rid of the built in browser app</b>. my theory on this one is to make hacking the console less easier. did the built in PS4 browser suck ass? yes. did i still used it to watch pirated movies there? also yes. this is honestly a minor issue but again... it still something that worked and got removed for no reason.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>i am satisfied with these changes</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>the <b>dualsense controller is pretty cool</b> though the reactive triggers take a bit to get used to but you can always disable that. the built in mic on the controller is honestly a wonderful feature and i'm also have that the mute button is on the controller instead of being somewhere of the console's control panel.</li>
        <li>console itself has A LOT <b>more windows for air flow and fans</b> compared to the PS4 which makes it not over heat so much compared to the PS4</li>
      </ol>

      <p>i think this is everything nice i can say about the console. i got nothing else to say about it and i can't give it the credit of being able to run fortnite at a constant 60 fps. that's your entire job <img src="/!g/pix/angry-cat.gif"></p>
      <p>overall i am happy to be able to play the games that i used to on my PS4 once again, but is this really a meaningful upgrade compared to the previous version?</p>

      <h2 class="entry"><span class="title">my beautiful madoka dics</span><span class="date">01.jun.25</span> <span class="weather"><img src="/journal/weather/sunny.gif" alt="sunny weather"></span></h2>
      <p>during my last madoka magica rewatch on december 2024 i was thinking about how ass it is that i have have to watch this through some shady ass anime site where the eng subtitles barely work so i had to watch the eng dub instead. like damn that sucks! and i'm not paying for a crunchyroll subscription either! so i decided to eventually start looking for physical versions of the <b>anime</b> and <b>rebellion</b> once i had a bit of money to spend.</p>
      <p>while looking through ebay i noticed that some region A blu-rays of madoka were AWFULLY a bit expensive. especially the box sets. i initially thought that physical versions of PMMM were simply out of stock though their official stores. <small>and this is not the case btw, you can get some sets over at the <a href="https://store.crunchyroll.com/collections/puella-magi-madoka-magica/" target="_blank" class="outlink">crunchyroll</a> store... at Normal prices.</small></p>
      <p><img src="!g/0601-madoka-anime-box.jpg" width="25%" style="float:left;margin:10px;" alt="PMMM anime bluray box">one day i stumbled upon a listing of a madoka blu-ray labeled <q>PMMM Disc I & II</q>. the listing mention it was from a box set but my foolish ass didn't bother to look more into it. you see, i was thinking that disc I & II had PMMM beginnings and eternal respectively. or at least 6 episodes on each disc. but then the blu-ray arrived and um. it was not what i was thinking!</p>
      <figure>

        <img src="!g/0601-madoka-anime-sleeve-2.jpg" alt="PMMM bluray cover featuring mami">
        <figcaption>bluray cover of <i>PMMM Disc I & II</i> with madoka and the reversable side with mami</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>each disc has 4 episodes. meaning that i was missing the last final 4 episodes of the anime. <img src="/!g/pix/angry-cat.gif" alt="angry emoji"> honestly for the price of $40 i decided to keep it bc i don't think the anime (not the movie versions of the anime) is getting any more blu-rays anytime soon. there are minor differences between the movies and the anime, but at least i have the iconic scene of hitomi going <q>girls can't love girls!!!</q> (happy pride month btw <img src="/!g/pix/gaycat.gif" alt="cat with a rainbow emoji">) with this purchase since that scene is missing in the movie version of the anime. i did some more digging and i found the disc i was missing. unfortunately the only listing of it (separately) i'm seeing on ebay is at $108 and there is no way i'm touching that at that price. i'm gonna keep being in the look out for it nonetheless and if i get another madoka disc, i'll write another log about it.</p>

        <figcaption>front and back of the <i>limited edition rebellion</i> blu-ray box alongside the full cover for the disc box</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><img title="here's what the box looks like without the disc case" src="!g/0601-front-empty.jpg" alt="bluray box without the discs box" width="30%" style="float:right;margin:10px;">i eventually got the limited edition <b>rebellion</b> blu-ray for a pretty nice price and MAN is that how you do packaging. this has to be one of the most gorgeous and detailed packages that i've ever seen. i love the whole theater / play motif that is used in the series as well. whoever designed this did such a great job. it includes 3 dics: the movie, an extra disc with bonus features, and the OST. the OST was a very pleasant surprise to have here. i listened to it on my portable CD player while hanging clothes and man... what a beautiful score. it's so delicate. my favorite song from there is possibly <a href="https://youtu.be/xs1IZQywogo?si=2PqXGXJ5kXqOms6Z" target="_blank" class="outlink">this is my despair</a>.</p>

        <img src="!g/0601-opened-empty.jpg" alt="disc box opened with the curtains opened and the discs removed">
        <figcaption>opening the disc box greets you with this! i love the art that gets uncovered when you remove the discs.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><img src="!g/0601-material-book.jpg" alt="material book front cover" width="40%" style="float:left;margin:10px;">it also included a material book with an interview from members of the crew, inu curry artworks, storyboards, other art and posters! i loved seeing these very much, specially the inu curry artworks. to my luck everything has been translated to eng by the <a href="https://wiki.puella-magi.net/Rebellion_Material_Book" target="_blank" class="outlink">puella magi wiki</a>. thank god i dont have to photo translate this because it is lowkey incomprehensible when i tried to do it.</p>
      <p>on my 6th watching of rebellion i am still noticing new things about the film. watching this on my tv via my PS5 who works part time as a blu-ray player feels SO awesome. i like owning blu-rays of my favorite movies (should do a list of the ones i own someday on my site!) so these dics were a much necessary addition to my collection since i'm always on shady places to be able to watch them. <mark>i love physical media</mark>.</p>
