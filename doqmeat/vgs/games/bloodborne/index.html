		<p><b>24.jun.25</b> the moment arrived. honestly eileen's fight was MUCH harder than i had anticipated. took me a good couple of tries til i could kill her. like i even had to stop fighting her in order to farm vials and bullets which was starting to annoy me a little bit so i said fuck it and asked my girlfriend how to get to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRzYb3Xx_HM" target="_blank" class="outlink">infamous cummmfpk chalice dungeon</a> in order to farm echoes for vials and bullets. and my god. does this change everything. but i'm pretty much sticking to using the farmed echoes for shop purchases. because i feel like otherwise it would take away from the challenge of the game if i use it to level up my character. anyway, rest in peace, eileen. you will be missed. she must be one of the hardest hunters you fight in game because WOW.</p>

		<p><span class="date">20.jun.25</span> been a while since i've updated this but i'm still making progress! ok so FIRST of all <mark>my latest achievement in this game has been being able to beat <i>martyr logarious</i></mark> because WOW did that get some time to get used to his moves. but once you got that down, the fight gets very very manageable. i think it took me like. 10 times or something like that to beat him. the trick was to do as many viceral attacks as i could since that's what was doing most of the damage to him. also, i did not mean to aurafarm when i activated the fire paper my bad. below i share a clip of the last moments of the boss fight.</p>

		<p>my online friend, hina, came to my world to help me out with <i>rom</i> which made the fight insanely easy. i was already told the fight wasn't going to be hard but that the baby spiders are kinda annoying. i never got to experience that because i basically explored the entirety of <b>byrgenwerth</b> with my friend. very small place.</p>

		</figure>
		<p>after <i>rom</i>, i stumbled upon yahar'gul once again. i am scared! of what's happening in game but i will persevere. i checked some of my lamps and noticed two of them weren't working: <b>hypogean gaol</b> and <b>grand cathedral</b>. hypogean gaol is probably disabled because i just got to yahar'gul and some shit is most likely going down over there. but grand cathedral..... ermmm.... i don't think i've mentioned this here but i am currently playing in a save file that dates back to 2018 when this game was free through PS+. idk what was wrong with me back then but i aggro'ed <b>eileen the crow</b> and well. i've heard that because of that she will eventually want to kill me. this is that moment. i am pretty sure the lamp has been disabled because of that. <img src="/!g/pix/catsob.gif"> i'm so sad i did that because she seems like such a cool character... but oh well. we move forward. it is safe to say i have a fight with her pending *gulp*.</p>
		<p>there's also some items and places i would like to explore a bit more in-depth before going deep into yahar'gul... so i will probably do that before advancing further into this insane story. oh i also figured out how to take nice screenshots in-game without my character appearing in them. nice. you just gotta use the monocle + sitting emote + hide the ui. i actually got that little trick from this <a title="Let's Explain Bloodborne As We Play" href="https://youtu.be/U1U784baqIA?si=-vYsN6y5uTr80tAl" target="_blank" class="outlink">youtube video</a> i've been watching as i play the game. <small>i have no clue what is happening in this game 99% of the time.</small></p>

		<p><span class="date">30.may.25</span> <b>I BEAT THE 3 BROS</b>. i am finally back where i was when my PS4 stopped working! i might explore the forbidden woods before diving deeper into new territory though cus i'm missing some items from that area. i feel like i'm starting to get a bit more of confidence with this game... slowly but surely.</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span class="date">25.may.25</span> leveled up 3 times and also went to the clinic and to the castle. i love playing this game and its story and the setting but i also forget how scary playing it is for me <img src="https://doqmeat.com/!g/pix/emote1crying.gif" alt=""> which makes me get really tense at times and even find the game a bit exhausting to play as well.... wish i was built different but i am not <img src="https://doqmeat.com/!g/pix/emote13dots.gif" alt=""> so i downloaded the <i>official strategy guide</i> into my tablet and that has helped out a bit with my overall anxiousness while playing. i honestly just need to unclench and stop being so scared of dying in a game where dying is literally one of the core mechanics.</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span class="date">22.may.25</span> WE ARE SO BACK???? i bought a <a href="../../hardware/#PS5">PS5</a> recently and i am SO ready to dive into this world again. lucky for me, since i had PS+ at that time <b>most of my saved data</b> was able to be uploaded to the cloud storage. the only bad news is that it seems that a portion of what i last played did not seem to upload to the cloud. i noticed this when i noticed i was missing the castle cainhurst lantern and the lantern you get when you kill the 3 bros <b>THAT I HAD FOUGHT WITH SWEAT AND TEARS...</b> so i got some exploring to do at the current moment before i get to where i was!</p>

		<p><span class="date">05.jan.25</span> the wired controller did not work. but you know what, eventually i will sent out my PS4 to get the wifi chip replaced. i wont give up!!!! i am hopeful for my 9 year old PS4! i am poor! and i want to keep playing bloodborne JLDFKJSDFJ</p>
		<hr id="7">
		<p><span class="date">11.dec.23</span> i don't know why i just thought about this but i think <i>if</i> i a bought a WIRED ps4 controller, i Would Be Able to play bloodborne again..... don't really feel like dropping 20 bucks just for that though. i really like the little messages people place in these games and if i play again i won't have that &lt;/3 so yeah i don't have much desire to buy that controller despite me missing the game! i thought about getting my ps4 fixed that first week it went nuts, but at that point i might as well just wait 5 years or something until i can afford a ps5. ahhhh <img src="/!g/pix/emote1pout.gif"></p>
		<hr id="6">
		<p><span class="date">14.sep.23</span><a title="journal log" href="/journal/2023/09#14" target="_blank">no more bloodborne til further notice</a></p>
		<hr id="5">
		<p><span class="date">04.sep.23</span>soooooooooo you might be wondering what has happened to bloodborne after me playing nonstop for the entirety of july <img src="/!g/pix/catscared.gif"> welp... i wrote about my woes with my ps4 in a <a href="/journal/2023/08#18" target="_blank">journal log</a> if you'd like to read more about it. but basically, the ps4 controller does not want to connect to it due to a faulty bluetooth / wifi antenna. sigh <img src="/!g/pix/catfall.gif"> honestly, i barely play on it nowadays so like if this were the end of my ps4 i'd be like damn... but okay. BUT I STILL NEED TO FINISH BLOODBORNE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i bought a replacement for the antenna so i'll update this page to let yall know how that went and if my bloodborne journey (ps4 exclusive btw) ends here <img src="/!g/pix/catsob1.gif"> i miss playing it a bit too! so i hope i can get that fixed</p>
		<p>but to catch up where i last left in the game before my ps4 decided to hate me: i explored a bit more of the cainhurst (? idk if that's how it spelled) castle and found a boss with a VERY cool scythe but oh my god... this one is going to be ROUGH. he's not that fast but he is pretty quick in executing his moveset. and i am very used to my hunter axe but i can tell it's gonna be a bit troublesome to defeat him with the slow weapon that i have.... i gave this boss a try 3 times. i think all those times i got him to half health. which isn't bad. but also the fact that we are fighting on a roof makes things even more stressful because in one of my runs i died CUS I FELL from said roof :[</p>
		<p>it is safe to say that IF i can get my ps4 fixed again, i will need a GOOD warmup before i try to fight that boss again. UGH but i do miss bloodborne a normal amount &lt;/3 so sad </p>
		<hr>
		<p><span class="date">20.jul.23</span>today i got to cainhurst castle! (happy but also shivering from fear) you know ive noticed that im always VERY tense when playing this game. its crazy bc i do enjoy it but oh my god. i really cant deny that despite getting the hang of this game it is still Really scary for me <img src="/!g/pix/emote1scared.gif"> its like i love it because the atmosphere is so well made but i also hate how it makes me feel so much <img src="/!g/pix/catscared.gif"> gripping my ps4 controller for life</p>
		<img src="scenerycastle.jpg" width="100%">
		<p>i liked the view here tho. nice place to take a quick breather. only for me to get scared in the next 10 seconds PLEASEEE</p>

		<p>as you can see i really but really take my time getting through these levels (tho theres some rare cases where i just have to say fuck it and run pass them). while exploring this place theres these ladies with swords (honestly good for them i guess) and they are VERY slow but all of a sudden this happened and i went <i>NOPE, me and my 20k echoes are outtie</i>. yall take it easy. i had just unlocked a shortcut too so it seemed quite fitting to stop the journey there</p>

		<p>right after this i spent exactly 8 minutes fighting like 10 5ft long worms. horrible i know. i hope i never encounter them again in another level because wow were they such a pain for just being skinny ass WORMS</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span class="date">16.jul.23</span>wrote a blog post about my experience with bloodborne and anxiety. this game has helped me out with coming to come to terms with some things about myself and gave me a new perspective on my own struggles <img src="/!g/pix/cateepyy.gif"> if you'd like to read it you can do so <a href="/blog/2023/230716-bloodborne" target="_blank">here!</a></p>
		<p>in other news, i've been progressing a lot through the game! im about to go to the forbidden woods (i think its the game...) and also i think i might be a bit overleveled so i should be good to go <img src="/!g/pix/emote2thumbup.gif"></p>
		<hr>
		<p><span class="date">23.jul.23</span>SO. i beat another boss!! my heart wanted to get out of my chest on this one good lord. i tried my best not to panic and it REALLY paid off. this fight was sooo long for me holy moly. but i did it! i REALLY thought i was going to die and after all, this was just my first try at the boss so you know. but just WOW...
		<p class="centered"><small>sorry for the bad mic quality i didnt have it out but i forgot to mute it DFJLFD. you can hear my stress and desperation to just finish this damn fight</small></p>

		<p>i unlocked the next area as well, but i think i will keep exploring the forbidden woods, and maybe even that castle i went to a couple of days ago before proceeding to the next area</p>

		<hr>
		<p id="log1"><span class="date">08.jul.23</span>been playing bloodborne recently and YEAH its pretty scary (for someone like me) but it is so fun!!!!! i had given this game a try back when it was free for ps+ in 2018 and i did like it but every time i died i felt horrible so i stopped playing it LKFJDLj but since i got ps+ again i decided to give it a try once more. and i think this time it hit me. my girlfriend has also been helping me out giving me tips and tricks throught my journey YAY!<br>i have much more to write about this game but soon i will be publishing an in-depth blog post about bloodborne and my experience with it so please stay tuned for that!

		<h4>weapons</h4>
		<ol>
			<li><b>hunter axe</b> - been there since day 1. i just really love the range on this thing.</li>
			<li><b>kirkhammer</b> - with a strength build i decided to give the kirkhammer a try and i ended up really liking it. i mostly use the sword though... haven't used it a lot transformed. i feel like at that point i might as well use my axe. but i like the sword when fighting fast enemies.</li>
