<p><span class="date">27.jan.26</span> I AM STILL ALIVE and i am still playing this game. i didn't play a lot during august 2025 - december 2025 because... uni. but i got to play a bit more during the winter break. i finished main story and started the itzaland story. i really love the new map but the controls are a bit... eh. i had to change the controls because there's an abily where you have to aim and now it's a bit of a hassle to change between abilities. the arrow ability is really neat but then the dews of inspiration in wishfield are just so easy now with the arrow... but you know what i appreciate the help.</p>
<p>the latest event story, <b>life as a poem</b>, kinda killed me. i did not expect to play an infinity nikki quest and be talking about death and how it gives meaning to life. i still play but not a lot because of uni and life but i'm still playing. i really like this gacha. i call it the purple gacha.</p>

<p><span class="date">28.jul.25</span> nikki season coming to an end! i was so happy when i got this outfit OMGGGGGG</p>
<img src="250728-white-moth.jpg" alt="nightlight whispers" width="100%">
<p>i love the moth look of it so much....</p>
<details>
  <summary>i also acquired the hair of the other outfit in the same gacha which i also loved it very much but i found it a bit of a pain to dye because of it's limited areas.</summary>

  <img src="250728-dye2.jpg" alt="dyeing nikki's hair" width="100%">
</details>
<p>i had no clue what to do with it so i just dyed it purple and ran with it. i ended up creating an outfit based on the moth accessories. i recently got the shrinking outfit too which i love the dress for it so so much!!! i decided to use it for this and made some sort of purple nikki moth fit. so lovely.</p>

<hr>
<p><span class="date">20.jul.25</span> still playing through the main story and can i just say that i love the pieceys very very much.</p>
<center><img src="250720-pieceys.jpg" alt="selfie with some pieceys" width="100%"></center>
<p>i find them so unique and adorable. their arc has been possibly my favorite one so far from the main story quest. i also really the abandoned district area quite a lot as well, i like the verticality to it. and i kinda get it but i do wish i could use the gliding ability outside of that place.</p>

<hr>
<p><span class="date">25.may.25</span> dipped my toes into the nikki universe since now i own something that can run it. fuck. once again i am promising to myself and to the world that i will not spend real money on this game. anyways. it looks very cute and it is what it is: a cute and somewhat entertaining game about collecting things. that's honestly good enough for me in between my <a href="../bloodborne/index.html">bloodborne</a> breaks. as a sucker for fashion in games, i <em>love</em> the photo and fashion options alike! but from the looks of it , i already know the best fits will be behind that gacha system. as always.</p>
<p>anyway. here's some pics with my friend the panda. the other one is me!</p>
