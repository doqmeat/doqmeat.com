		<p><span class="date">24.dec.24</span> okay, having started <a href="../style-savvy-fashion-forward/index.html">fashion forward</a> i still think this game looks a bit uglier... but this is looking to be the most interesting storyline out of all 3 games. and i do hate to admit it! but despite finding the gameplay pase a bit slow compared to the other games, <i>styling star</i> also <b>probably</b> might have the best request system too. since there is a lot of plot related request that make the game and the NPC in there a bit more alive! i'm so sorry for being so mean to you, <i>styling star</i>, i had to play <a href="../style-savvy-fashion-forward/index.html">fashion forward</a> in order to really see your beauty.</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span class="date">29.nov.24</span> i've been still playing this game every once in a while but there is still something about it that makes me not love it as much as <i>trendsetters</i> despite having so many improvements in its gameplay. i have no clue why this game looks worse than trendsetters, given that game released on 2012 and this one in 2017. <i>styling star</i> looks very blocky, pixelated. maybe this was due to time constraints or something??? because we also have to keep in mind that this released at the very end of the <b>3DS</b>' life. but i don't know man. i feel like trendsetters has a very specific aesthetic and charm to it. i guess in a way styling star feels and looks cheaper to me.</p>
		<p>i also find it a bit hard to actually enjoy being at the shop. a HUGE improvement they provided in this entry was that you could put a customer on hold whenever they wanted something that happened to be out of stock. this is great on its own. but i think i would have really appreciated having a little memo on my phone with the client's request. because i forget! call me a 2 year old but i tell the client to wait, i get side tracked by other things, and when i finally go to the shopping center, i have completely forgotten what the customer wanted. this happens frequently and it sort of breaks that flow of the gameplay that i really like in these games.</p>
		<hr>
		<p><span class="date">27.oct.24</span> been playing this on and off and my verdict? i fear that it is just okay <img src="/!g/pix/emote1crying.gif" alt=""> like don't get me wrong, there are SOOO many improvements from <a href="../style-savvy-trendsetters/">trendsetters</a> to this that i appreciate. like being able to tell a customer that you don't have exactly what they want but to wait for you while you restock. but... i don't know this game doesn't exactly click for me like <i>trendsetters</i> did. i'm not sure how many hows i'm into this game but hopefully in the future i can give a clearer answer as to why.</p>

		<p>on another note, i do think that something this game does wonderfully is having more "lively" characters. i am a bit invested in what is going on with them. and some of them are even funny!</p>

		<p><span class="date">03.sep.24</span> started playing this right when i finished playing <a href="../style-savvy-trendsetters/index.html">trendsetters</a>. i asked on my private twitter if i should play <i>styling star</i> or <i>fashion forward</i> next and my only oomf who has played the style savvy games voted for <i>styling star</i> so!!! here i am.</p>
		<p>first thing i noticed about the game is that there is no 3D option <small>unless my game is bugged but? i don't think that's it.</small> and taking a look at the release date being in 2017 then yeah that makes a LOT of sense, since i know nintendo was barely pushing the 3D gimmick of the 3DS at that time. i don't think i've made it pass the tutorial of the game, but once i have a few more minutes with the game i'll come back to this to write some more of my thoughts.</p>
