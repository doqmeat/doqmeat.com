# doqmeat website

hello! this is the repository of [doqmeat.neocities.org](https://doqmeat.neocities.org/) !! 
i code in brackets.io and upload my code using github desktop following miss moss's [deploy to neocities template](https://github.com/burned-salmon/deploy-to-neocities-template)

## source code notes

i learned how to code HTML and CSS by looking at others peoples code and <b>playing around with it on my own</b>, so you're welcome to do that with mine.

all i ask is to <b>NOT copy the entire code and upload it to your site.</b> the only code you can do that with are with my [free to use templates](https://github.com/doqmeat/F2U-templates)

i'm still pretty new to all of this so any pointers on something i could be doing better is very appreciated! this website is just for fun and i am learning at my own pace!
