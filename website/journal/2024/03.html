			<p>wanted to show something i'm working on for art class!</p>
			<center><img src="!g/240307-mizu-paint.jpg" alt="inked painting that is a work in progress of mizu" width="50%"></center>
			<p>we are working with contrast right now so i decided to do a drawing of my cat, <a href="/shrines/mizu" target="_parent" title="mizu's shrine">mizu</a> <img src="/!g/pix/dumy.gif" alt=""> we are painting it with chinese ink! i'm no where near done LOL but i really enjoy what i've been doing so far in the class! it's like a nice little breather from the other ones, despite being so early in the morning... <img src="https://doqmeat.neocities.org/!g/pix/emote2eepy.gif" alt=""></p>
			<p>i've only started uni (again) just 2 months ago and i've been able to adjust pretty well in contrary to what i was thinking. though i do have to admit that uni is way. WAY easier when you can just focus on this and that's it. i don't how i would handle having a job and going to uni at the same time (AGAIN) but that's a problem for future me. <small>either way it would be very funny if i got hired for some random retail job after applying a hundred times for the past 2 years. lol.</small></p>
			<p>my very first exam was a precalculus one and i got a 96% on that! yay! though to be fair, i had to STUDY for that shit especially because we can't use calculators (LET ME KNOW IF YOU GUYS TOOK PRECALCULUS WITH A CALCULATOR OR NOT PLS??) AND I WILL BE REAL: i barely remember the multiplication tables or how to fucking divide decimals and dumb small things like that because i've gotten so used to calculators <img src="https://doqmeat.neocities.org/!g/pix/emote1tears.gif" alt=""> but i knew this beforehand (thank god) and spent almost an entire day practicing how to do all of that stuff by hand. it also doesn't help that i am just Slow when it comes to basic math skills.... AND YET i still made it <img src="https://doqmeat.neocities.org/!g/pix/emote2thumbup.gif" alt=""> good for me! good for me.</p>
			<p>another class i've been enjoying a lot are my social sciences class (<i>ciencias sociales</i> in spanish, i will refer to this class as CISO in the future). i've been learning a ton in that of stuff that i just ??? had no clue about. DOES ANYONE know that the <a title="wikipedia section" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics_in_the_United_States#Puerto_Rico" target="_blank">US tested oral contraceptives on poor and uneducated women in puerto rico around the 40s? before it was approved by the FDA</a>? not me!! and i'm not being like <i>whattttt? the united states using a colony for their own gain and abusing of the people in said colony? no wayyyyyyyy broooo</i> but like? just crazy they don't bother to teach us this in schools. or at least TO ME THEY DIDN'T! which is such a shame... and i'm not talking about this topic specifically. there are just SO MANY bits and pieces of puerto rican history that i am Just starting to find out recently. i hope that can change that in the future, because i think those things are worth teaching in schools. and not like my school where a nun was telling the whole class that if you're gay you're going to hell. but that is genuinely ANOTHER few paragraphs for ANOTHER time.</p>
			<p>phew. anyway, what was i saying..... uni... i spend most of my free time in between classes in the library. using their wifi. i'm either studying for other classes here or working on my site and there is no in between :)</p>
			<hr>
			<p>as i have previously asked in my <a href="https://neocities.org/site/doqmeat?event_id=3494728" target="_blank">neocities profile</a>, i've also been reading on and practicing javascript whenever i have some free time! i am currently reading an e-book (recommended by <a href="https://jeith.neocities.org/" target="_blank">jeith</a>!) that comes along with links to exercises for practice and i've been getting the hang of it so far! i mean, i am in the first few chapters after all <img src="/!g/pix/catsweat.gif" alt=""> but at least i am starting somewhere! i'm actually keeping track of the stuff i've learned on my <a href="https://doqmeat.github.io/learning-js/a-smarter-way-to-learn-JS.html" target="_blank">github pages</a>! i thought it would be nice to do so, this way some of this New Stuff can stay in my head while i get used to it. other neighbors also game me other recommendations so i've linked them all on my <a href="/notebook/links#js" target="_parent">links</a> page for future reference.</p>
