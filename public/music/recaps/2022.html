<h1>2022 music summary</h1>
	 <small>note: this is a copy of a notion page i have! i did not have my own website back then... excuse the mess i have yet to finish cleaning up this page oops</small>
	  <h2 id="songs" >top 20 songs</h2>
	   <h3>1. utopia / the one - drippin</h3>
		<p>having to choose between these two songs is so hard so i just did not do it. honestly i did not expect to Love this album as much as i do the first time i listed to it.</p>
		<p>now about the songs i listed here: im pretty sure i shed a tear when i listened to <i>utopia</i> for the first time. that intro is so fascinating to me even if it sounds pretty simple but i just love it so much. it never fails to give me goosebumps. BUT ALSO. the samples of <a title="nostalgia mv" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdUCdh7ff9I">nostalgia</a> were just the cherry on the top for me. i LOVE nostalgia so much. its one of my fav songs from them, and its how i was introduced to them. listen. im pretty sure im biased. but man. hearing samples of their debut title track kinda got to me guys JLSDFKDFSL. i think i cried at some point. probably. </p>
		<p>and <i>the one</i> is just really fucking good. that chorus. I LOVE DRUM N BASS!!! that chorus is so good and when i found out this was the direction they were going for their title track i literally jumped. love u drippin and the production team thank you for the good music.</p>
		<p>edit: i might make a page for drippin, or even for the villain: the end album here bc wow</p>

	<h3>4. always in a dream by kinoue64</h3>
	<p>this is the softest track on this list. this song is quite special to me and yet i dont really know why. it just is. the gentle-ness of miku's voice accompanied with this type of instrumental <img src="https://pixels.crd.co/assets/images/gallery02/89b9bf32.gif?v=8becb5d1"> yeah. highly recommend this vocaloid producer if you're into this type of stuff aka shoegaze and/or dreampop</p>
