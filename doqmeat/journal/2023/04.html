		<p>i started watching <mark>jojo's bizzare adventure</mark> a few days ago with my bf! i'm still in part 1 and so far it has made me laugh which is good bc i don't i would normally be into that kind of stuff but my bf said that it gets gayer and sillier so i will be watching. and i've also been watching <mark>better call soul</mark>. after finishing rewatching breaking bad like a year ago i thought it was time to watch better call saul and holyyyyyy moly. i did not expect to like this so much <img src="/!g/pix/catsob.gif"> on season 3 so far. i'd do anything for kim wexler
		<p>and well :) i think that's it for today. I WILL NOT STAY UP TIL 5AM TONIGHT. will do a little bit of web surfing and take it chill for the rest of the night. i thinkkkkk. someones having a come back (kpop related) tomorrow but i dont remember who. oooooooh its lesserafim. okayyyyyyyy i do wanna tune it so expect that in the listening log soon ok see yall!

		<p>alright well. i went to a waterfall yesterday! had to climb for a little while to get there, and lets just say that i need to start exercising more bc WOW... i almost fainted or something <img src="/!g/pix/catsob1.gif"> when i finally got to the waterfall i started feeling so fucking dizzy that my vision started turning black and i almost couldnt hear anything. had to sit down for a good couple of minutes. but wow. i really need to go on like daily walks or something. it was really bad. but! when that kinda went away (i was still a bit shaky) i got in the water and it was so good. i should go there more often.

		<p>AND TOMORROW..... i will try to jump my car... i hope the battery isnt bad cus like. id hate to waste 200 dollars for a new one. in my current state


		<p class="date">23.apr.23</p>

		<p>WOWIE!!! yesterday i was fighting for my LIFE trying to understand modals and javascript (i still dont understand it.....) BUT! i just kept googling codes and mixing them up till i got SOMETHING and <a title="fav albums page" href="/music/page/fav-albums" target="_blank">BOOM!!!!!</a> I DID IT!!!! i wanted the album page to have a pop up so i could write my thoughts, fav songs, and what not in there, and i made it work!! of course this was just me mixing up codes from tutorials i found (which are linked in the credits page!) but WOW. it felt like hours trying to figure out how i could make that work. most of the problem was that i didnt know how to make the album cover img work as a button so on click the info would pop up. but then i saw a tutorial where they had a button on top of a img so i figured!!!! if i could have the button be transparent and expand to the entire image then this could work <img src="/!g/pix/catidea.gif"> and it did! so yay for me :3
		<p>other than that. i need to jumpstart my car <img src="/!g/pix/overwhelmed.gif"> i dont go out a lot and i make sure to at least turn on my car every every week so it turn ON but this time.... this time it nah im out. i put the keys on the ignition and NOTHING wanted to turn on, ughhhh. having a car is so. i would say annoying. they should make a car that doesnt have to be turn on every week. that would be so helpful to me.... this is the 3rd time that it happens. and it would also be Really cool if someone employed me!! so i could do something! with my life. ah...... oh well.


		<p class="date">22.apr.23</p>

		<p>i will sometimes be skipping days btw! but anyway. yesterday i watched <i>evil dead rise</i> with my girlfriend! it was pretty good and scary tbh. i need to watch the previous movies. specially the first one. really liked how campy it was at times. i liked it! but my god. i forgot how annoying the theater can be when theres teenage boys watching a HORROR MOVIE. actually ive been out of high school for years and i dont go out a lot so i Really forgot how annoying they can be <img src="/!g/pix/catslap.gif"> they were just making stupid comments at full volume and nobody was giving a fuck <img src="/!g/pix/happy1.gif"> it was very embarrassing for them. but yeah. solid 8/10 movie btw i recommend. also played a bit of <i>super mario galaxy</i> on my bf's switch. that game is so fun i've never played it before. and i started watching <i>better call saul</i> with him as well! i had finished watching breaking bad like..... 10 months ago so yeah i think its time to watch better call saul
		<p>and today i've just been working on my art section which i finished btw!!! gotta see what's next for me and this website. and yeah. havent done much. as always. sigh. been feeling a bit weird as well. just. idk
		<p>alright. i know its gonna take me a while to do the video games section sooo i made a box listing my fav things (vgs, animanga, shows, and more) on my <a href="/about">about</a> page! and with that im done for the night

		<p class="date" id="20">20.apr.23</p>

		<p>WOW............. WOW wow wow wow wow......... ok so do yall remember when i said that i had interview today? well <img src="/!g/pix/skull.gif"> let me tell you a fun story. the email SAYS the interview is at 12pm. but they called me at 10am. obviously i missed the call because i thought the interview was at 12pm like IT WAS SCHEDULED?!?!? so i called back, and you know what the employee says? "yeah i dont think the manager will be making any calls at 12pm" and hangs up...................... <img src="/!g/pix/emote1vangy.gif"> <img src="/!g/pix/catslap.gif"> at the moment i was so frustrated and sad that i just started sobbing. this is so fucking unfair WHAT?????????? its 1pm rn. i dont think they'll be calling any time soon... <img src="/!g/pix/catfall.gif"> <img src="/!g/pix/crying.gif"> man. im just. this past week has not been fucking easy. i am so tired. of everything really. and im sick of it.
		<p>well anyway,,, i will be more active today. will be working on my listening log entry for seven sins. so i guess thats something i can look forward to today
		<p>i made a <a href="https://music-grid.surge.sh/#128-40-16-288-1024-128-320-144-2-576-16-288-1-256-544-2048-&200&major">little tune</a>

			<h3>content warning: death, suicide, depression</h3>
		</center>
		<p>today i woke up with the news that astro's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_Bin" target="_blank">moon bin</a> had passed away by taking his own life. i really cannot describe how i felt when i saw this. i really hope moonbin is finally getting the rest and happiness that he deserves. he was loved by so many people. my condolences goes out to his fans, friends, and family. especially his sister, <a href="https://kprofiles.com/moon-sua-profile-facts/" target="_blank">moon sua</a>. i did not know much about moon bin, but from his apperances with his sister and on music shows, he seemed like a very nice person. always with a big smile on his face. it is heartbreaking to think about what moon sua is going through right now as well and i truly wish her the best and hope she takes all the time it takes to recover. again, rest well moon bin. know that people will forever have you in their hearts.
			<center><img src="!g/230419-moonbinandsua.jpg"></center>
			<center><span style="font-size:13px">moon bin & moon sua</span></center>
		<p>kpop as an industry has a lot of problems, especially with the mental health of their idols. but this is a topic i will touch another day out of respect for moon bin and his passing.
		<p>as someone who has been (and still is) in a bad place mentally, i genuinely cannot imagine how lonely moon bin must have felt like, for him to do what happened. and my heart is very heavy for him. i know what its like to feel so alone, so hopeless, that you start to think that maybe death is the answer to all of your problems. to everyone and to myself: please take lots of care. you arent alone and there's people who care about you. please reach out to someone if you find yourself in this place mentally. this has helped me before, and in case anyone else needs it heres an <a href="https://www.helpguide.org/articles/suicide-prevention/are-you-feeling-suicidal.htm" target="_blank">article</a> about what to do if you're feeling suicidal. love you all
		<p>i'll be taking it easy today and won't be adding anymore logs to today's entry.

		<p>the file for the sidebar's javascript (so its the same on all pages) looks so fucking scary KDFSDKFJDLFK. but its mostly bc the html code in it breaks if i like. put it in different lines cus the file thinks its javascript.... <img src="/!g/pix/annoyed.gif"> if anyone knows how to make the html part of <a href="/sidebar.js" target="_blank">this</a> look decent let me know. cus editing it to add anything to that html part is such a headache
		<p id="carrd">i was thinking earlier too about how it could a... maybe fun? learning experience to try and convert my <a href="https://desteny.carrd.co">carrd</a> to html. or at least try to. cus i know its not going to be easy (for me) but i still love that design i did based off yukika's soul lady album so much <img src="/!g/pix/kiss-cat.gif"> so if you see me messing around a testing page that kinda looks like a carrd layout, thats that! i really have no clue how im going to do the seperate sections that only come up when you click the buttons tho. like my main problem is that i dont know how i would hide them in the page. but oh well. i guess i just gotta look deeper into google. but i also dont really know how to word this very well to be able to search my problem properly... F
		<p>also i think at this point its pretty obvious to say that my life is not really that interesting <img src="/!g/pix/skull.gif"> and honestly stuff can get pretty... depressive real quick if i do decide to overshare. but i dont necessarily want to hide that either. i have depression and anxiety, and you know i recently noticed the huge contrast of my website vs well. myself. you look at my site and its so bright. happy. excited. and i am kinda like that irl!!! but ive def been having some struggles with my mental health to the point where i just feel. mostly sad all the time. im not really going to get into it. so sorry for those reading this and wanting more context. but i recently noticed that contrast was like a neat observation since that wasnt really my intention.
		<p>um anyway. very excited for drippin's new single!!! <img src="/!g/pix/emote1music.gif"> that <a href="https://youtu.be/ve-WFRORKzY">last teaser</a> they dropped sounds so fucking good i love strings so much i really cant wait to hear it. i hope woollim keeps the newtype production team employed for a long time bc i just love the stuff they have done for drippin's discography. i have to wait til 5am for that tho ughhh. but its ok. maybe i'll catch up with fortnite in the meantime.
		<p>ok so i lied. my ass did not play fortnite and instead i was working on my art page. but anyway HOLYYYYYYY shit. that drippin comeback was so good to me. well 2 songs out 3 were really good. to me. i'll def have the listening log entry of that up sometime up today. and i was also thinking of making a post just discussing the overall comeback as a whole. talk about the mv, styling, choreos, etc. hmm. i'll think about it


		<p class="date">17.apr.23</p>

		<p>WOWWW i literally said yesterday how i was a bit bumped out that i hadnt been contacted after my last interview... well guess what? i got called for another interview. a part of me wants to be excited, but this whole process of trying to get a job has been so tiring as well. the interview is on thursday so wish me good luck yall
		<p>i think its incredible the amount of times ive cleaned my browsers cached images and files in the last 4 days of me making this site <img src="/!g/pix/skull.gif"> yeah im one of those ppl that barely touches that "clean cache" button im sorry
		<p>boyfriend sent me a video game meme template today so i filled it out, wanna share it here as well! heres the link for the <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ft9yPXvWYAE-us0?format=jpg&amp;name=medium" target="_blank">template</a> if you wanna do it yourself

		<p class="date">16.apr.23</p>

		<p>i wrote in my status yesterday that i was going to do like 100 today related to the site and honestly? i learned from that. i wont say that again <img src="/!g/pix/catsob1.gif">
		<p>overall today was pretty chill. but i kinda feel like i should be doing something else. probably trying to print out more resumes since the company that interviewed me like a month ago hasnt contacted me again..... sigh <img src="/!g/pix/catdizzy.gif"> and it feels bad but i know i shouldnt be feeling so down by it. i really need to get into the grove again of applying for jobs</p>
		<p>holy shit. you know its been insane learning abt html and all that jazz these few days. and i should log it too. i just learned about margins. this changes everything. hmm. with this knowledge im prob gonna change a few things around tomorrow. honestly like despite having that tumblr theme expirience i am pretty new to all of this, and while at times it can be quite... frustrating cus i dont know anything, its pretty cool when i manage to understand and achieve the simple thing that i was trying to do. like how to add a fucking margin <img src="/!g/pix/catsob1.gif"> i wonder what i'll learn tomorrow


		<p class="date">15.apr.23</p>

		<p>also i need to make a 88x31 button or banner (idk whats the actual name help) for my website but i literally got no clue how or what to make the banner about. im thinking of just putting the cat minecraft plushie there. im cool with that being front and center of my "brand". cat minecraft plush. i need to get one actually they are so cute. yet another thing to add to my stuff to buy when employed. yay.
