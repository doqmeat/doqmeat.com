					<p><b>24.dec.25 - 12am</b> started trying to configure doqmeat.com through 11ty and NOPE! i don't think i want to deal with that. i feel like this site just has so much stuff that if i want to implement something like i have to start from 0. for now i am stuck with copying and pasting pages and you know what? what's okay... </p>

				<article>
					<p><b>08.dec.25 - 1am</b> kinda wanna put my entire site through a static site generator bc it would make pages like <a href="/vgs">vgs</a>, <a href="/journal">journal</a>, <a href="/blog">blog</a>, <a href="/music">music</a> so much easier and i can stop relying on iframes as well but the thought of having to deal with THE REST of my site on a SSG just gives me nightmares.... so... i'm not quite sure what to do. the only SSG that i have knowledge on is 11ty and but man it would be so greatttt if i could use it for the other pages... maybe i'll figure it out one day. i need to test it out first of all.</p>

					<p><b>16.jul.25 - 10pm</b> been messing around with <a href="https://11ty.dev" target="_blank" class="outlink">eleventy</a> in hopes of getting something together for pages like my <a href="/journal">journal</a> and <a href="/blog">blog</a> but i've been having trouble trying to figure out how i could have eleventy working only in some directories of my website. i tried putting my entire site through eleventy but given how big my site is, it's not something i really fuck with... i fear <i>doqmeat.com</i> will be hand-coded til the day i die. though i def have to say that static site generators are pretty neat! i might move my journal log to a different subdomain at some point so i can run it through 11ty but i ain't doing all that right now. i am thinking of using it for my <a href="https://sinnamota.doqmeat.com" target="_blank">siinamota fansite</a> though...</p>

					<p><b>17.may.25 - 5pm</b> some stupid ass saw an ebay listing of a madoka magica bluray for only $45 and it had two discs so he thought the 2 discs were the 2 FIRST MOVIES which are basically the entire anime portion but no actually! the first 2 discs are episodes 1 - 8 !! I AM MISSING EPISODES 9 - 12 WHICH ARE ON ANOTHER DISC! I AM THE STUPID ASS!</p>
					<p>i will still keep it though because again... its kind of crazy to find the anime on bluray at an okay price. i will just keep an eye our for listings of the other disc... idk why the bluray of madoka is so pricy, it's not even out of stock or a limited edition or anything so like why do i have to pay $120 for it. but this is honestly something i've been meaning to get on bluray so im happy that i have AT LEAST the first 8 episodes here. <button onclick="showPic('!g/250517-madoka-bluray.png','front cover of the madoka magica bluray','the cover is so pretty though, i will scan it eventually. kinda want it as my background.')">madoka-bluray.png</button></p>

					<p><b>03.apr.25 - 4pm</b> in my (soon to be!) 2 years of having <i>doqmeat.com</i> i've had a couple of... questionable messages pop up on my chatbox and guestbook. i always delete them whenever i see them. <b>on <u>my</u> site</b> i do not let messages like that (mean for the sake of being mean) about me or my site roam around. though today i got one from someone saying something along the lines of <q>stop doing this, this is a waste of time</q>. it got me thinking how this place that i have built from the grown up is literally anything but a waste of my time. i've gotten to experience so many new things because of my interest in building this. i will always cherish my site. thank you for reminding me of that! oh, they also called me a nerd which i found really funny. does anyone get offended these days from being called a nerd? i should have let that message up, that was really good.</p>

					<p><b>27.mar.25 - 4pm</b> i've also been trying to do some coding stuff ~for fun~ outside of my websites! i recently found out that you can build apps with the awesome trio of HTML/CSS/JS with a framework called <a class="outlink" href="https://www.electronjs.org/" target="_blank">electron</a> so once i have a little bit more of free time. i wanna try doing something with this!</p>

					<p><b>27.mar.25 - 4pm</b> sooooo ummm. yeah i might not be able to talk normally for like. week or two. and man. is it so frustrating not being able to talk. i am honestly mostly sad about it because i love participating in my classes and i haven't been able to do that at all this week. for future reference and for anyone who needs to hear it: please do not push yourself over a minimum wage job. all in all, i've been super busy with uni but specially calculus. that class is taking EVERTHING from me to be able to get the concepts. i might have talked about it here but i am so fucking slow with math. i have to spend like an absurd amount of time understanding things when it comes to math. it doesn't really click easy for me. and the amount of time that i've put into that class is basically almost all of my free time. and at the end, because of some dumb mistakes i didn't see in the 1st exam, i got a C. and i took the 2nd exam sick and with a headache and i lowkey forgot like half of the procedures so let's pray i end up getting a C on that one as well. at this point i just wanna pass the class with a C and i'll be happy. but man. I AM SLOW AT THIS.</p>

					<p><b>25.mar.25 - 10am</b> sick once again... not sure with what but it has lasted for more than a week. i can barely talk right now bc i had to go to work yesterday and the talking kinda fucked up my throat. sigh... i wish i didn't get sick so frequently. i was not like this pre covid.</p>

					<p><b>24.feb.25 - 10pm</b> students from the computer science department have been doing some activities and today they talked about text editors. given a lot of people were already familiar with VSC we voted on trying out neovim. and man What The Fuck. like yes, i am intrigued but WHAT THE FUCK? how to people use this for coding i feel like i would kill myself if i ever tried to use neovim as my main text editor for coding. i can sort of see it as note-taking software tho. which brings me to share one of my <a title="By Default - Simple, Non-Commercial, Open Source Notes" href="https://youtu.be/XRpHIa-2XCE" target="_blank" class="outlink">favorite youtube videos ever</a></p>

					<p><b>23.feb.25 - 5pm</b> this month will probably be first time ever i skip a month in my <a href="/journal">journal</a> page! i have 2 exams at the end of this week <small>(for my <i>calculus 1</i> and <i>intro to programming</i> classes!)</small> so it's very likely i won't be doing any logs for february. i've been doing monthly journal logs here since... april 2023. kinda crazy tbh! during the early stages of my site, i kinda just talked about whatever there. nowadays i try for my journal logs to be more... thoughtful i guess. atm i don't really have much to talk about. uni has kept me busy but i also appreciate it for that. guys i kinda love studying i'm not gonna lie. i'm lowkey unemployed. i still have my job! but i barely get any shifts, and the shift that i end up getting conflict with my uni classes... idk man shits kinda frustrating sometimes <img src="/!g/pix/catfire.gif" alt=""> but everything else has been pretty okay.</p>
					<p>i did some <i>calculus</i> exercises yesterday and i got them all right. it made me shout <q>YES!!!</q> and jump out of joy from my desk. that little moment reminded me of this page from <a href="https://pluto22.neocities.org/" target="_blank" class="outlink">pluto22</a> called <a href="https://pluto22.neocities.org/prettythings" target="_blank" class="outlink">pretty things</a>. life really is all about small moments like that. i love visiting that page every once in a while.</p>

					<p><b>13.feb.25 - 10am</b> something that i failed to mention on my last log was that my site having such a reach also means that it will inevitably get to places outside of its target. scary places. it is the internet after all and everyone does have access to it. but with this said, the positives will always outweigh the negatives. i will continue to have fun and silly and be <u>me</u> on the internet no matter what <img src="/!g/pix/emote1lov.gif" alt=""></p>

					<p><b>02.feb.25 - 12pm</b> i clicked on a random <a title="★ stargirl lee - you should make a personal website and join the indie web ^_^" href="https://youtu.be/4I48N6pGu2Y" target="_blank" class="outlink">youtube video</a> about the indie web and to my surprise my website was mentioned in it! it kinda takes me aback the reach my personal site has had. from people telling me they love the look, to just saying how they relate to the things i write in here. i am very grateful. i recently reached 1000 followers on neocities. that is a crazy number to me. i never thought my site would reach as many people as it has when i first created it. its pretty heartwarming to see something i created for <i>myself</i> to be so recognized and enjoyed by others.</p>

					<p id="241030"><b>30.oct.24 - 12am</b> woke up today to a laggy af laptop and when i restart it i get an error that my FANS are not working properly...... <img src="/!g/pix/emote1scared.gif" alt=""> opened my laptop up, 1 out of the 2 fans was so so so dusty... i cleaned it up, plug it out and in but it doesn't spin while the other one does. ordered some replacement fans which i hope will fix the fans issue. and i also found out that my laptop was being super slow because the CPU was capping itself at 0.20 ghz... i'm guessing it somehow knows theres an issue with the fans and it's capping itself on purpose so it doesn't get cooked. the weird thing is that my laptop has been WAYYY hotter before and the CPU has never capped itself. but i guess this is a bit different? this laptop was pretty expensive ($1k, for my standards) and its about to be 3 years old next march so i feel like if it kicks the bucket this early, i might actually sob <img src="/!g/pix/crying.gif" alt=""> i have an external mini fan blowing cool air to the back of the laptop and the CPU hasn't capped itself yet. so at least i know <b>it is</b> related to the fans.</p>

					<p><b>29.aug.24 - 12am</b> been learning a bit more and more about python as i go to my compsci class. very basic stuff though. learned how to use my terminal to do python too. not really sure how ppl would prefer (or how it is more convenient?) to code something on a terminal instead of an editor but idk! prof also showed us an online <a href="https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/" target="_blank" class="outlink">compiler</a> we can use, though i think i will stick to my buddy brackets as an editor and use my git bash to display the output.</p>
					<p>which btw, talking about my terminal... i was wondering if there was a way to customize a bit more in-depth how terminals look and it finds out that there actually <i>is</i> a way of doing it! i downloaded <a href="https://ohmyposh.dev/" target="_blank" class="outlink">oh my posh</a> and it works wonderfully on my git bash. i will admit it took me a good second to understand how to set it up but i think it was relatively easy. <button onclick="showPic('!g/240829-bash.jpg','screenshot of my git bash','theres a ton of cool themes but this neko one caught my attention because of the layout. i loved the thought of a little cat speaking to me. another cool thing is that you can also customize these themes however you want. so i added a little GUP! in there because lately i have been pretty obsessed with saying that out loud. in reference of that swimming cat of course.')">!g/240829-bash.jpg</button></p>
