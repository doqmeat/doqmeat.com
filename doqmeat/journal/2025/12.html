      <p>i am <b>FREE</b> once again! i just got done with my 4th semester of university. this semester was such a fucking wild ride. at least for me it was. i think because of this it also felt like i blinked and BOOM. finals upon me.</p>
      <p>but man did i have fun! i'm pretty sure i've already talked about this in my past entries, but it's been so fun to talk to so many new people and get to know them. i'm glad i took the chance to get more involved and just be more 'out there'... hell, i even did a small <a href="https://desteny.me/posts/css-workshop" target="_blank">workshop about CSS</a> this semester! despite some hardships i had, i'm really happy for myself.</p>
      <!-- pictures here and there -->
      <p>my computer science classes (<i>discrete math</i> and <i>data structures</i>) were pretty interesting too this semester and i really liked them! i was really trying my best this semester but when it came to the finals i barely studied tbh <img src="/!g/pix/laugh-covering-face.gif" alt=""> could have sneaked in a bit more of study time here and there but worst case scenerios i will literally just pass these two classes with a B instead of an A. my favorite part of <i>discrete math</i> must have been when we were simplifying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_logic" target="_blank" class="outlink">propositional logic</a>. i kinda fuck heavy with that kinda stuff. and funnily enough, on my final there was an exercise were i had to prove a logical statement was equivalent to another logical statement and i straight up just forgot how to do it JLJSJD AND IT'S LITERALLY MY FAVORITE TOPIC FROM THE CLASS fuck my stupid life bro.... i also really liked the whole division algorithm thing. which made me understand how CSS classes like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Selectors/:nth-of-type" target="_blank" class="outlink">:nth-of-type()</a> work. when i got to hashing and recursive complexity (which i still need to understand bc i don't really quite get how to to this!) <i>data structures</i>, it made me realize how much of this stuff was making More Sense to me because i was currently taking discrete. meanwhile in <i>data structures</i> i think the most fun i had in that class must have been when we were working with queues and stacks. i did a "search engine" that would take as input a word and would read files from a directory to search in which files the word you just searched appeared the most in. i hope to do something like that but for my website!</p>
      <p>AND TALKING ABOUT MY WEBSITE! there's a <a href="https://github.com/doqmeat/doqmeat.com/issues/35" target="_blank" class="outlink">couple of things</a> that i want to do around but FIRST i've been thinking so much about putting doqmeat.com into a static site generator such as <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/" target="_blank" class="outlink">11ty</a>. it would make pages like THIS ONE and others around here so much easier to update and maintain. but my god will it be a lot of work to convert each of my pages into something that 11ty doesn't fuck up. i have a pretty good grasp of how 11ty works, so hopefully i will be able to do something with that around here. it's just kinda hard to do with so many directories, pages, and assets that don't really follow the same template. i also wanna start learning new things this winter break like PHP, react, and stuff like that! so i hope to put my free time to good use!</p>
      <p>part of my winter break is gonna be a vacation where i'll travel to AZ and spend time with my mom and sisters. i'm pretty excited for it since it means that:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>i get to see <a title="my cat mizu" href="/shrines/mizu" target="_parent">mizu</a> again</li>
        <li>i get to see snow during this trip!!!</li>
      </ol>
      <p>i think i haven't seen snow since 2015 i am pretty sure... not that i am always dying to see snow. but snow is pretty cool when you live in a place that doesn't snow. well at least for me. and i'm kinda happy for that bc i feel like i would be terrified of driving if there was snow on the road. yay.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>ever since i took my final FINAL exam, i've been building stuff like crazy. so far i've done 2 little pots of flowers. they are so cute. i really can't wait to build the one my girlfriend gifted me, but that will have to wait after my vacation! </p>

      <p>overall, that is pretty much my plans from my break! work on web projects, build stuff irl, and have fun playing video games. here's a list of games i wanna play during my break:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/vgs/games/bloodborne" target="_parent">bloodborne</a></li>
        <li>silksong</li>
        <li>because of my vacation, i will have my 3DS on me which means i will probably play a lot of the <b>style savvy</b> games</li>
        <li><a href="/vgs/games/infinity-nikki" target="_parent">infinity nikki</a></li>
        <li>continue <a href="/vgs/games/fallout-new-vegas" target="_parent">fallout new vegas</a> DLCs</li>
        <li><a href="/vgs/games/cato" target="_parent">cato</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>next time you hear from me should be from a 2025 music recap!!! i haven't talked much about what i've been listening to this year so now is the perfect time for that.</p>
