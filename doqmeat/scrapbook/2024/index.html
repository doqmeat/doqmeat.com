					FUCK...... as someone who recently lost their grandma, this one hit me hard as hell. i've been meaning to watch this ever since it released on theaters, but i don't think it ever screened where i live. anyways. literally yesterday it got put on netflix and it HURRIED to put it on and FINALLY watch it. my god. this is the loveliest thing i've ever watched. marcel's relationship with his nana reminded me so so so much of mine with my grandma. one of the main themes of this movie is change. what nana told marcel about "don't stop living because of me" is almost identical to what my grandma had told me once. i really related to this tiny shell and his dynamic with his shell nana. i don't think i could have watched this at a better time. change can be scary but it is inevitable, so we must continue to move forward.

				HOLD ONNNNNNNNNNNN why was this so good?!?!?!?
				<br>I REALLY enjoyed this though. i am not a pro when it comes to fallout lore but i absolutely love how they depicted the different mega companies and their insane ideologies and goals.
				<br><br>honestly when this first got announced i was super scared because i thought it was going to be a slop of different references from the games here and there and call it a day. there's this fallout meme that i constantly think about constantly that's like <i>"don't mess with us fallout fans! we blindly idolize the concepts our games criticize"</i> yeah that was my worse case scenario for this series. but to my surprise they handled the themes of the games really well.
				<br><br>
				i might be hyping it up LOL but for me the plot was really good and captivating. insane. and the show was also very funny without having to rely heavily on cheap references. honestly surprised at the amount of quality this has. also dogmeat :3
