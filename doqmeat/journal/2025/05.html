      <p>hello everypony! it's been a while since i've been here! i was super busy with uni which is why i didn't update so much throughout these past 2 months.</p>

      <p>i feel like this semester i got to open up a bit more to people. i met a lot of new people and got closer to others. which is very nice as someone who struggles to make friends. i also got to join my uni's organization for and ran by computer science students which has made me talk to new people. i really hope i can continue doing that. having an easier time meeting new people and such.</p>

      <p>this was a pretty fun semester but man did it felt so busy! which is probably why i feel like this one passed by the fastest. it was probably <i>calculus</i>. any free time i would have i would dedicate it to that class. which was the class that brought me the most pain this semester. i sort of like math not gonna lie. but oh my goodness. it took A LOT from me for things to finally click, which they did like 4 days before the final YAY <img src="https://doqmeat.com/!g/pix/emote2thumbup.gif" alt=""> throughout the semester i had 3 partial exams. and in all 3 of them i got C's but i feel pretty confident on the final so i am hoping for a B and worst case scenario a high C! i still have to take <i>calculus 2</i> for my degree so i am not quite done with <i>calculus</i> yet. i do want a break so i will be taking <i>discrete math</i> next semester.</p>

      <p>out of all the classes i was taking, my highlight was my <i>intro to programming</i> class. <em>of course</em>. i'm gonna sound so nerdy but i always looked forward to this class. i learned so many things (a little bit more in depth) that i was already a bit familiarized with and how they worked and why they worked. i also really like the professor as well. i feel like i talked too much in that class <img src="https://doqmeat.com/!g/pix/emote1cov.gif" alt=""> because i was mainly the one asking questions and stuff. but oh well, at least i was having fun with the class! honestly it was lowkey a bit of a breeze but i still got really engaged with the class nonetheless.</p>

      <h3>my summer plans</h3>

      <p>i bought a new <a href="/vgs/hardware/index.html#PS5" target="_blank">PS5</a> very recently which was honestly a great motivator for studying for that <i>calculus 1</i> final. you can see more of my thoughts on the console on the link provided. been playing <a href="/vgs/games/bloodborne/index.html" target="_blank">bloodborne</a> and <b>overwatch</b> a lot as of late. alongside a bit of <a href="/vgs/games/fortnite/index.html" target="_blank">fortnite</a> and <a href="/vgs/games/infinity-nikki/index.html" target="_blank">infinity nikki</a>. on my laptop, i hope to finish <a href="/vgs/games/fallout-new-vegas/index.html" target="_blank">fallout new vegas</a> <small>(which im only missing the dlc's to complete)</small> and also keep playing some more of <a href="/vgs/games/cato/index.html" target="_blank">cato</a>! as you can see i have MANY games that i want to play and finish so i hope i can get some of that done throughout these months.</p>

      <p>i also plan on making a new page for the music index that would basically be an walkman mp3 JS player. i feel with my current knowledge of things, i might be able to make it! alongside that, i will also be updating some old code around here. early this year i found a site called <a href="https://roadmap.sh/" target="_blank" class="outlink">roadmap.sh</a> and i have been following their <a href="https://roadmap.sh/frontend" target="_blank" class="outlink">frontend</a> roadmap and man have i learned so many little things about HTML and CSS that i didn't know about! so i hope to finish going through this summer.</p>

      <p>i go to uni via train so throughout the semester i am pretty active compared to my breaks. so i want to make it a goal to go on daily walks! i also just miss walking over all tbh.</p>

      <p>my birthday is in exactly 1 week too! i can't believe i'm turning 25.... idk it just feels a bit crazy. i really never had an idea of what my future could look like. i wasn't even sure if i even had one to begin with. but i sure am glad to be here. i will be buying a delicious ice cream cake that day for myself.</p>
