		<p>the first version of my site!! i used a <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/petitgarcon/688695677850714112/1999-neocities-layout-by-me-emotion-preview?source=share" target="_blank">layout</a> that i had found on tumblr and just started my way up there! it helped a lot since i did not know a lot abt html or css.</p>

		<p>honestly i really liked how it just <mark>looked like a bunch of sticky notes and i thought that was so charming</mark> <img src="/!g/pix/heart1.gif"> i didnt know a lot about html/css the coding for this looked pretty HORRIBLE. like those graphics that you see on top of the sticky notes? yeah i was just doing all of that with <i>top bottom position absolute</i> on seperate divs in the body tag and calling it a day <img src="/!g/pix/catsob1.gif"> which is not bad!!! it did the job but because of that the process of moving them was so tedious and it would take sometimes HOURS trying to align them pixel perfect. so funny. but i learned!</p>

		<p>since i was just learning, most pages (if not pretty much all of them) were following this sticky notes theme! i did like it but i wanted my pages to look different from each other so the site would be more interesting and fun to work on imo. so i started redoing every page when i got done with that i redid my homepage to the one you see today! (as of now...)</p>
