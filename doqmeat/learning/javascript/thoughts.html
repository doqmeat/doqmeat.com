	<h1>i'm learning JS</h1>
	<main>
		<h2 id="thoughts">my thoughts as i learn</h2>
		<p>i find it kinda weird that the <a href="https://javascript.info" target="_blank" class="outlink">guide</a> i am using for JS doesn't use <code>console.log</code> at all and instead uses <code>alert()</code> which i know it's doing the same thing bit idk i feel like the console telling me whatever it needs to tell me is WAYYYY more useful than seeing it pop up in a alert. BUT NONETHELESS i've been really digging this guide because i feel with other tutorials that i was using they weren't very focused on the user Really understand the fundamentals behind the programming language. but so far i've been having a nice time reading and doing the practice tasks by myself. it really takes me back to my <i>intro to programming</i> class, and i really like that it's kind of a refresher in that sense as well! win win. i'm currently in the <i>objects</i> section which is definitely where the unknown territories of JS (for me) are staring to popup. i think something very interesting i've learned about have been <mark>arrow functions</mark>. very neat!</p>
		<p>ALSO this whole time i had been wondering if there was a way to get the console log on my VSC without having to live preview an HTML file that had the current script i'm working on. recently i found out about the extension called <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WallabyJs.quokka-vscode" target="_blank" class="outlink">quokka.js</a> and it literally changed my life for quick testing JS variables and such.</p>

		<p>so far i've managed to do a couple of things around my site, i introduced a dialog box when clicking the chatbox tab and it asks you to agree to the rules. i was originally going to do it with an <code>alert()</code> but then i later found out about <code>confirm()</code> which is PERFECT for what i wanted to do. also learned i can do a custom one using the <code>dialog</code> element so in the future i'll get to that :p <a title="github source code" href="https://github.com/doqmeat/doqmeat.com/blob/main/doqmeat/!f/v5/script.js#L45" target="_blank" class="outlink">code snippet</a></p>
		<p>i've also found a way to iterate through the years using the javascript <code>Date()</code> constructor <small>need to look up this term later...</small> so i don't have to write the same piece of coding every year for my microblog! also cleaned up the code a bit so it's easier to use for me. you can see the changes for all of that <a title="github commit diff" href="https://github.com/doqmeat/doqmeat.com/commit/4f99cd5cef3b42988b7089074761adeb8ce285a5#diff-deafc4cb713ec8a76a49ac6ef62c1c023c326730b300588fcfd8f171030e0a9e" target="_blank" class="outlink">here</a>. it kind of gives me an idea for my <a href="/journal">journal</a> page for the calendar iframe but... i'm not sure if i'll go with it at the end of the day. we will see!</p>
		<p>been also writing more comments on my JS files. it really is nice when you go back to them and know wtf each thing does. thank you professor.</p>

		<hr>
		<p>my class <i>introduction to programming</i> (which focuses on c++) is kinda doing wonders for all the things that i've done with JS without really knowing WHY they worked the way they did... i'm also currently reading <i>JavaScript All-in-One For Dummies</i> which i had saved in a pdf from god knows where. i think my previous knowledge + my class is making the first few chapters of this kinda of a breeze but wow!!! i have learned so many little things about JS so far that i didn't know about. been mostly reading it on the train so i have a few notes of stuff i want to practice and write about on this page once i have some more free time. but at least for me, i think <mark>it is way easier to get all of this new information from a book</mark> rather then a documentation site (w3schools, mozilla, etc. etc.) it def makes the process of learning these things way less intimidating.</p>
		<p class="date">05.mar.25</p>
		<hr>
		<p>learned how to remove classes and add them with an event like so:</p>
		<textarea style="height:90px"> for (i = 0; i < buttons.length; i++) {
    buttons[i].classList.remove("active");
  }
  event.currentTarget.className += " active";</textarea>
		<p>still need to dig deeper into events because as i was coding this on VSC, i kept getting a warning saying that <code>event</code> was deprecated but then my question was... then how do i do this? </p>
		<hr>
		<p>in my compsci class we've been talking about operators like <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>not</code> which helped me out a bit when making my <a href="/fashion">fashion</a> page's javascript! in this case i used the <code>or</code> which is written like this <code>||</code> in JS for an if statement so that the mobile/responsive view of the page could be as neat as possible. honestly it was pretty fun to figure that out and get it working. i really need to look more into what <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget" target="_blank">event targets</a> are though.</p>
		<hr>
		<p>the <a href="https://doqmeat.github.io/HTML-templates/yukika/script.js" target="_blank">javascript</a> for my yukika passport is SOO messy but it does work! i am SURE there's probably a whole other way of doing this but i haven't quite gotten there yet.</p>
		<hr>
		<p>figured out how to do a box pop up and a img modal of sorts! i put a class tag on all that imgs where if you click them then i take the <code>src</code> and <code>alt</code> text into the img modal. you can check it out on the scans page of my <a title="currently a WIP!" href="https://siinamota.doqmeat.com/scans/" target="_blank" class="outlink">siinamota fansite</a>. i also use a similar thing for the imgs on my <a href="/microblog">microblog</a> but with a different method.</p>
		<p>also learning how to use this bit of code with the examples mentioned above <br><code>i = 0; i &lt; example.length; i++</code></p>
		<hr>

		<select>
			<option selected>what style should the box be???</option>
			<option onclick="toggleDark()">dark</option>
			<option onclick="toggleCat()">cat</option>
		</select>

		<div id="box">
			<p>hi this is inside a box! </p>
			<p>this is a <a href="/">link</a>. this is <b>bolded</b>. this is <i>italics</i>. this is <mark>highlighted</mark></p>
		</div>
		<p><a href="files/practice.js">source code</a></p>
		<hr>

		<p>note: i am still wrapping my head around the difference between <code>==</code> and <code>===</code> when i used it for a toggle like this. but i'm starting to understand some stuff!!!</p>
		<button id="HKbutton" onclick="popHK()">if you click me something will pop up :)</button>
