			<h1 class="entry"><span class="title">tropical storm</span><span class="date">13.aug.24</span> <span class="weather"><img src="/journal/weather/cloudy.gif" alt=""></span></h1>
			<p>my first week of classes was supposed to be this very week but because of the incoming storm, they have been canceled. which i am a bit sad about because i was really looking forward to seeing the friend i made from my past precalculus class! and also, i just miss taking the train and being at my uni.</p>
			<p>it is 12pm as of typing this, and the storm should arrive on wednesday, august 14 at 2am. classes should start again on thursday but given how fragile our power grid is, i highly doubt it i'll be back in uni this week. i don't think the storm should be <b>that</b> bad, so maybe i'll just be 1-3 days without electricity.</p>
			<p>yesterday, i went out to make my preparations. my apartment is not in the best conditions. <mark>the ceiling leaks</mark> AND <mark>my kitchen and living room starts flooding whenever it rains a lot</mark>. this might honestly be the reason why i'm able to afford it. but besides that, it's not a bad place to live in. anyways, due to the reasons mentioned above, i bought some more buckets for the ceiling leaks so i can stop using bowls and pans for that, and i also got some of those table party plastic covers to cover some of my stuff. in case it starts leaking in a new place where there's stuff underneath it.</p>
			<p>now, for the flooding... there is not much i can do about that. i already have some towels on the floor on the places that usually start to flood, which makes it easier to control it. but this storm will be arriving at 2am. i do not plan on staying up til the sun rises mopping my entire apartment. because i'm aware of the flooding problems of this apartment, i do not have any wooden furniture touching the floor, or really anything that shouldn't get wet on the floor <small>(self reminder to get roomba and cables off the floor)</small>. so i basically plan to chill on my bed and try to get a good sleep, that way, i can just start mopping when i get up. the flooding is mostly just fucking annoying. but like i said, i don't think any of my stuff will get damaged because of it <small>(self reminder 2: pick rug off floor)</small> and because its just a tropical storm. i don't think the water will even get to my ankle. well let's hope.</p>
			<p>i think i'll be alright here nonetheless. besides the buckets, i also bought a tiny battery fan, which will be SO SO SO useful with the insane heat that has been happening lately. i will probably shower more than 3 times per day (without power) to refresh myself. i have a solid amount of food and i also have some ice and coolers in which i can store my food so it doesn't go bad on the fridge. i will have my laptop, switch, 3DS, phone, other phone, charged up along side some battery banks so like i am all good there. though during times like these, i mostly just sleep it off. in order to save charge on my electronics and all of that. and also to save myself of the annoyance of having to be awake in such a hot weather.</p>
			<p>i haven't mopped in a while so at least my kitchen and living will get a crazy good mop afterwards! good for them! good for them.</p>
			<p>the lights are flickering as i'm typing this <img src="/!g/pix/skull.gif" alt=""></p>
			<p>ANYWAYYYY to end this off, i've been through a cat 5 hurricane so like with the knowledge and trauma from that, i'm pretty sure i will be okay. and of course with all that said, do expect some inactivity from me. take care everyone!</p>
