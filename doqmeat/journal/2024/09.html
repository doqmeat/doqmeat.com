			<p>after coding for so long with <b>brackets</b>, i have been making the move to <b>visual studio code</b>... brackets... my sweetie pie... i will forever miss you. but sadly, the live preview of brackets has been really buggy as of late. i downloaded VSC for computer class since it makes python wayyy easier than brackets, so i've been getting more comfortable with using VSC. like don't get me wrong, VSC has a Lot of great things. i really like the feature where you can hover over a property or a tag and it will give you a brief definition of it. it has a TON of settings. i think i spent like 2 hours going through the settings. but i think despite all of this, i will still miss the simplicity of brackets. and also, VSC just feels a bit laggy... though i might have to change some settings so it performs a bit better. </p>
			<p>i think i need a better theme though.</p>

			<h2>small life update</h2>
			<p>anyway, besides all of that nerd talk, i've been pretty okay! i haven't been that Busy but i am still quite busy, you know? all in all, not much has been happening. uni is pretty chill. work is pretty chill, still tiring though. i bough a new desk for my room because my god. is it so fucking hot on my living room... decided to get one for my room which has an AC. i think best $40 i've ever spent.</p>
			<p>there's still a lot of things that i wanna do with my site but i just haven't really found the time to able to really work on them. and i'm also still working on my <a href="https://siinamota.doqmeat.com" target="_blank" class="outlink">siinamota fansite</a> which i started right when classes ended last semester but Man. if you look at my notion (where all of the info for the fansite is at) it might not look like much but creating the fansite with pure HTML and CSS has def been a big project!</p>
			<h3>yukika passport template</h3>
			<p>OH AND TALKING ABOUT PROJECTS: i had expressed last year that i wanted to re-create a <a title="carrd img 1" href="/music/!g/fav-albums/soullady-carrd.jpg" target="_blank">previous</a> <a title="carrd img 2" href="/music/!g/fav-albums/soullady-carrd1.jpg" target="_blank">carrd</a> layout i once had but in HTML. well... i actually did that during the summer break! i wanted to create a template based on this adorable "passport" inclusion from yukika's soul lady album.</p>
			<center>
				<img src="/music/!g/cds/yukika-soullady-passport.jpg" alt="" width="48%">
				<img src="/music/!g/cds/yukika-soullady-passport-in.jpg" alt="" width="48%">
				<small>scans of the actual passport</small>
			</center>
			<p>working on the template with just HTML, CSS, and JS was SOOOO much fun!!!! i got to learn a bit more about <b>CSS animations</b> which was a bit tricky at first but at least i know a little bit now. my goal was to make do like a page flip but at the end i kinda gave up on that goal LOL... maybe someday though! i still wanna do more with it but i'm happy with what i managed to accomplish with it! you can see the template for yourself <a href="https://doqmeat.github.io/HTML-templates/yukika/" target="_blank">here</a> and the template is free to use on <a href="https://github.com/doqmeat/HTML-templates/tree/main/yukika" target="_blank">github</a> if you wanna use it!</p>
			<hr>
			<p>on another note: i've been getting a lot of new messages lately and i feel a bit silly saying just <q>thank you</q> to each of you but i really appreciate all the small and big messages i've been getting as of late even if i don't reply to them right away. i'm always so happy whenever someone tells me they got inspired to code because of my site. i'm really happy others are taking on this journey as well! it also brings me to tears when i read that people resonate with the things that my site has, specially about my <a title="remembering my grandma blog post" href="/blog/2024/grandma/index.html" target="_blank">grandma</a> yall have been very sweet and i am very happy i got to share my memory of her here. so... <b>thank you!</b></p>
			<p>hope everyone is having a nice day / night.</p>
