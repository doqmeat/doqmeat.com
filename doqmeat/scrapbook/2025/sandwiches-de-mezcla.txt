i got this recipe from my mom and then proceeded to eye ball the ingredients as i put it in the blender. people do sandwiches de mezcla in very different ways which is why i can't even just link to another recipe bc they are all different! might make this into a proper page if i feel like it. if i make this again and get some measurements i might.
